# End to end, on a machine that has never seen the measurement target.
#
# WHAT THIS COVERS THAT `cargo test` CANNOT
#   Every test under `crates/litedoc4/tests/` fakes the extractor with a
#   `/bin/sh` script that copies a baked IR tree — deliberately, because needing
#   a Lean toolchain would mean those tests were never run. The cost is that the
#   **contract between the extractor and the Rust side is not checked by
#   anything**: change what `Extract.lean` writes and every one of them stays
#   green. This script is the one place where a real Lean environment produces a
#   real IR and the real pipeline turns it into a real site.
#
# WHY THE FIXTURE IS TINY AND MATHLIB-FREE
#   `e2e/micro` depends on Lean core and nothing else, so `lake build` takes
#   about a second and this runs on a free CI runner. The measurement target
#   pulls in all of Mathlib and can never be what a push is judged by.
#
#   It also holds, on purpose, the declaration shapes the target does not
#   contain — `class`, `inductive`, `class inductive`, a non-`mk` constructor,
#   an inherited field, an implicit binder on a field, an astral identifier
#   (U+1D49C, the U1/U2 traps), scoped notation. Nine of the renderer's 41
#   branches never fire over the real package (crates/litedoc4-render/tests/
#   page_parts.rs), and the first run of this script found one of them silently
#   rendering nothing: an inductive's constructors were missing from their page
#   while the search index still linked to them.
#
# THE GATES
#   1 ONE COMMAND    `litedoc4 build` over the fixture writes a site, and
#                    `tools/site-gate.sh` finds it internally consistent:
#                    0 dead links, 0 external resources, and the search index
#                    and the pages agreeing in both directions.
#   2 IDEMPOTENCE    the same command again, nothing changed: not one byte of
#                    the site different. The incremental path and the full path
#                    have to agree about a world that did not move.
#   3 DETERMINISM    a *second* full build into a different directory is byte
#                    identical to the first. Anything that leaks a hash order, a
#                    timestamp or a path into the output breaks here — and this
#                    is the invariant that replaces an external oracle, because
#                    it needs nobody's opinion about what the bytes should be.
#   4 --jobs         the extractor's parallelism changes neither the IR nor the
#                    site.
#   5 WORK           how much the two runs *did*, read out of
#                    `litedoc4-build.json`'s `work` record.
#   6 ONE EDIT       what a one-declaration edit costs, and that the tree it
#                    leaves is what a whole render of its own IR writes.
#   7 SORRY          the three shapes of doc-gen4 #270 — a direct `sorry`, a
#                    declaration that only depends on one, and neither — come
#                    out of the extractor as three different answers, by name.
#   8 ATTRS          every kind of attribute the extractor collects arrives in
#                    the IR as a `[name, value]` pair, split where the extractor
#                    knows the boundary and nowhere else.
#   9 GENERATED      the declarations `@[ext]` realizes name what they were
#                    realized from, by name and one step; the hand-written ext
#                    theorem sitting in the same environment extension does not;
#                    and the 33 declarations whose two ranges are equal without
#                    being realized keep the rule from collapsing into range
#                    equality.
#
# WHY GATE 5 EXISTS, AND WHY IT IS NOT A STOPWATCH
#   This project's product is speed and it had no regression gate at all. It
#   cannot have a wall-clock one: the oleans are mmap'ed, so the same unchanged
#   run's environment load moves by 5x with the page cache (2.5 s ↔ 13 s
#   【実測】, CLAUDE.md). A threshold over seconds is either loose enough to pass
#   a regression or tight enough to fail a cold runner.
#
#   What is decidable is the *work*: deterministic integers that do not care what
#   the machine felt like doing. GATE 5 asserts the shape the whole incremental
#   design exists to produce — a second run over an unchanged package
#   re-extracts nothing, renders nothing, and starts Lean not at all — and it
#   asserts that the three full builds did **identical** work, which is GATE 3's
#   determinism claim stated about the pipeline rather than about its output.
#
#   It reads JSON rather than grepping the log on purpose. GATE 2 used to check
#   the counters with `grep -qE '^render +modules [1-9]'`, which passes silently
#   the day that line is reworded — a gate whose failure mode is "quietly stops
#   testing" is worse than none.

say "10/15 GATE 9 — the origin of a realized declaration, and the three ways of not having one"
# `docs/plans/b0-generated-decls.md` measured that Lean gives a declaration it
# realizes from an attribute the position of **the attribute token**, and that no
# rule over `(line, col)` gets from there to the parent: in a 144-group Mathlib
# sample the parent was in the group 0 times and 47 groups spanned two or more
# namespaces. B-3's answer is that the extractor names the origin itself, from
# core's `extExtension` plus `selectionRange`.
#
# `Micro/Gen.lean` holds the four positions and the counter-example. Reads the
# IR, not the site: bundle B is extraction and IR only.
#
# FIVE THINGS, AND THE LAST THREE ARE WHY THE FIRST IS NOT ENOUGH
#   the origins       each named declaration's `generated`, compared whole,
#                     positives *and* negatives. `Micro.Gen.Solo.ext` is the
#                     sharp one: it is hand written and sits in the same
#                     environment extension as the realized theorems, so a rule
#                     that only asked the extension would claim it.
#   the count         how many expectations actually ran — GATE 7's lesson.
#   the strays        nobody else claims an origin. 9 in the whole fixture, and
#                     the number is asserted rather than the absence of
#                     surprises: a rule that answered "realized by ext" for
#                     everything passes every positive expectation above.
#   the trap          `selectionRange == range` is **42** declarations here and
#                     only 9 of them are realized by `@[ext]` — the other 33 are
#                     projections, constructors and a `scoped notation`. A rule
#                     that read the range equality as "generated" would claim 42
#                     and fail here 【実測 2026-08-21, and the same shape over
#                     2,786 Mathlib declarations →
#                     benchmarks/results/generated-decls-2026-08-21.txt】.
#   the falsifier     every origin named is a declaration this IR has, and none
#                     of the realized ones sorts *before* it. B-0 §13.2 records
#                     that as a property of one Lean version's `declRange`
#                     rather than a law, so it is counted rather than assumed;
#                     the three-toolchain version of this count is in the log

# `docs/plans/feature-sweep.md` C-1. Five assertions over `Micro/Math.html` plus
# one over the run's marker, and that last one is what the others cannot make:
#
#   the count            `work.mathFallbacks` is **1**, and one is the number
#                        `Micro/Math.lean` was written to produce. A fallback
#                        leaves a *valid page* — no byte count, no page count and
#                        no exit code moves when a formula fails — so without
#                        this number a run that converted nothing would look
#                        exactly like a run that converted everything.
#
#   conversion happened  three inline `<math>` and one `<math display="block">`.
#                        Exact, not "at least one": a renderer emitting a
#                        `<math>` per character would pass a lower bound.
#
#   the fallback is the source  `$\colim_k F(k)$` is on the page, dollars and
#                        all — what doc-gen4 emits for every span. A page whose
#                        mathematics failed is no worse than doc-gen4's page.
#
#   nothing is half-escaped  no `<` that opens no tag and no `&` that opens no
#                        entity, inside the `<math>` elements. This is the defect
#                        that decided the crate: `pulldown-latex` writes
#                        `<mo><</mo>` for `$a < b$` (61 of Mathlib's 2,123
#                        spans) and `math-core` does not. Swap the dependency
#                        back and this line is what says so.
#
#   the dollars are gone where it worked  `$a &lt; b$` must **not** be on the
#                        page. It is the fallback's spelling for the escape
#                        case, and finding it would mean conversion silently
