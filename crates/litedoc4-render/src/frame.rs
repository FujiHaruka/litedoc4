//! The page frame: `<head>`, the top bar, the sidebar and the module heading.
//!
//! **M8-b replaced this module wholesale.** Up to M7 it was a transcription of
//! doc-gen4's `baseHtmlGenerator` / `internalNav`, kept byte-identical because
//! the acceptance oracle compared bytes with doc-gen4's own output. That oracle
//! is gone (plan §1: gate A is suspended, and M8 stops claiming byte
//! compatibility), and what is here now is litedoc4's own frame:
//!
//! | doc-gen4 had | here |
//! |---|---|
//! | four CDN dependencies (Lato, JuliaMono, polyfill, MathJax) | none — the site renders from a bare directory |
//! | `<nav><iframe src="navbar.html">` | a sidebar the module tree is drawn into from `modules.json` |
//! | `</meta>` / `</link>` closing tags (Lean's `Html` prints them) | HTML5 |
//! | one `<script>` per behaviour, six of them | one `app.js` |
//!
//! The hand-written page this has to agree with is `design/preview/module.html`;
//! **keep the two in step**, because the stylesheet is written against that file
//! and a class renamed here silently loses its styling rather than failing.
//!
//! # Two things here are deliberate and look like mistakes
//!
//! 1. **The theme is set by an inline script in `<head>`.** An external module
//!    runs after first paint, so a reader on the dark theme would see a white
//!    flash on every navigation. The cost is ~120 bytes on every page.
//! 2. **The import list is sorted by [`crate::order::cmp_name`], not by string order.**
//!    `Name.lt` compares parents first: `Init` and `Mathlib` both precede
//!    `Init.Core`. This is doc-gen4's order and there is no reason to change it
//!    — it groups a package's modules together, which alphabetical order does
//!    not.
//!
//! Duplicate imports are dropped keeping the first occurrence, as they were
//! before: the module system does produce duplicates, and doc-gen4's DB hid
//! them behind an `INSERT OR IGNORE` (`DB.lean:162`).
