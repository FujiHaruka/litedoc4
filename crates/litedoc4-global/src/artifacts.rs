//!
//! # M8-d removed five files and their reader in the same step
//!
//! Up to M7 this module wrote six artifacts, transcribed from
//! `experiments/stage7h/global.ts:277-361` (frozen) because the acceptance
//! oracle was byte equality with doc-gen4's own build. Five of the six existed
//! **only** for doc-gen4's six JavaScript files, and M8-c replaced those with
//! `litedoc4-render`'s `web/src`, so the files went with their reader
//! (`docs/plans/ui-redesign.md` §8):
//!
//! | | why it is gone |
//! |---|---|
//! | `declarations/declaration-data.bmp` | 1,216,017 B【実測】read by `search.js` / `declaration-data.js` and nothing else — **and already broken**: it never carried `instancesFor` or `modules[].url`, so the deployed site's Instances For (245 pages) and Imported By (432 pages) did nothing【実測 2026-08-16】 |
//! | `navbar.html` | 57,949 B【実測】for an `<iframe>` nav that 決定 4 replaced with `modules.json` |
//! | `tactics.html` | one sentence with two counts in it; this package declares **0** tactics【実測】 |
//! | `references.bib` | always empty — written so that a link to it was not a 404, and the link is gone |
//! | `references.html` | constant HTML, same link |
//!
//! **`declarations/name-map.json` stays**, and it is the one that has nothing to
//! do with the UI: the incremental pipeline reads it back as `--before` to
//! compute the whole-package map delta (M2-b). Deleting it would leave the delta
//! comparing the new map with nothing and silently re-rendering too little.
//!
//! So the byte-reproduction denominator moves with the file list: **432 pages +
//! 6 artifacts = 438** was M6's, M8-d's is **432 pages + 7 artifacts = 439**,
//! and `docs/plans/search-v2.md` P0 makes it **432 + 8 = 440** by splitting
//! `instances.json` out of the search index (plus the 3 static assets, which
//! have never been in it — `tools/build-gate.sh` counts a tree that does have
//! them, which is why its number is 443 and not 440). The old numbers are not
//! rewritten — see `docs/milestone-log.md`.
//!
//! # Every sort here is UTF-16 (plan §7, U1)
//!
//! The prototype sorts with an argument-less `Array.prototype.sort()`, and the
//! bytes of `name-map.json` are that order. `Vec<String>::sort()` is UTF-8 byte
//! order, which agrees with it throughout the BMP and inverts at U+10000: `𝒜`
//! (U+1D49C) sorts *below* `ﬀ` (U+FB00) in UTF-16 and above it by code point. So
//! every sort goes through [`cmp_utf16`], including the ones in the new files —
//! not because anything compares them with the prototype, but because a site
//! with two orders in it is a site whose order is nobody's.
//!
//! # `serde_json`'s `preserve_order` is load-bearing
//!
//! Every JSON object here is built by inserting into a `Map` in explicitly
//! sorted order. A `BTreeMap` would re-sort — by code point, undoing the
//! paragraph above — and `name-map.json` would additionally lose the
//! interleaving of declaration and dependency names. The feature is set on the
//! workspace dependency; this module's `preserve_order_is_enabled` test fails if
//! it is ever dropped as unused. (Not a link: `#[cfg(test)]` items are invisible
//! to rustdoc.)
