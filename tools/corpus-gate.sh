# The tests that need the measurement target — run on purpose, never by accident.
#
# WHY THESE ARE NOT ORDINARY TESTS
#   A test owns its input. These do not: they read the 432-module package at
#   /Users/haruka/dev/lean-projects, its doc-gen4 reference tree, generated IR
#   trees and multi-megabyte `--full` recordings, none of which is in the
#   repository. `crates/litedoc4/tests/resident.rs` already draws this line —
#   "that needs a Lean toolchain, a built package and a 3 GB process, so it is a
#   gate and not a test" — and this script is where the line is enforced.
#
# WHY `#[ignore]` AND NOT A SILENT SKIP
#   They used to print "skipping: …" and return, which is invisible in an exit
#   code: on CI, where the corpus can never exist, every one of them passed
#   without running and the green said nothing about them. Worse, it hid real
#   rot — two of them had been skipping for want of a fixture that had been
#   deleted from this machine, and nobody could have told. `#[ignore]` makes
#   `cargo test` report them by count, and this script makes the set of them
#   auditable.
#
# THE INVENTORY
#   tools/corpus-tests.txt lists every ignored test. `--verify-list` fails if the
#   two sides drift, which is what CI runs: a test that quietly stops being in
#   the gate, and a gate that names a test nobody wrote, are the same bug seen
#   from two ends. Adding an ignored test means adding a line, on purpose.
#
# usage:
#   corpus-gate.sh                 run every corpus test (needs the corpus)
#   corpus-gate.sh --verify-list   only check the inventory (needs nothing)
#   corpus-gate.sh --list          print what cargo currently ignores
#   corpus-gate.sh --update-list   rewrite the inventory from cargo's answer

# Every `#[ignore]`d test cargo knows about, as `<target>::<name>`.
#
# The target prefix is not decoration: `the_corpus_matches_the_prototype` names
# three tests (ledger, impact, merge) and `the_whole_corpus_matches_the_prototype`
# names two (autolink, fragment), so a bare name collapses the inventory from 21
# entries to 19 and hides three tests inside their namesakes【実測 2026-08-23】.
# The prefix comes from cargo's own `Running … (target/debug/deps/NAME-HASH)` line.
# Asking each test binary directly, rather than reading `cargo test`'s combined
# output: cargo prints `Running …` on stderr and the binary prints the names on
# stdout, so the interleaving depends on whether stdout is a terminal. On a
# CI runner it is not, the names arrive in one block after the last `Running`
# line, and an awk script that pairs them up produces `::name` for everything.
# That is exactly the shape of bug this gate exists to catch, so it should not
# have one of its own.

    # **One inventory entry, one test binary, one test.** The gate used to hand
    # `cargo test --workspace -- --exact NAME` the bare test name, which is wrong
    # in three ways that each hid tests rather than failing:
    #
    #   1. `--exact` matches the whole path a binary prints, so entries of the
    #      form `litedoc4::packages::tests::NAME` cut down to `NAME` matched
    #      nothing — and `cargo test` exits 0 when a filter selects no tests, so
    #      three tests were reported run, and green, without running.
    #   2. Without `--no-fail-fast`, cargo stopped at the first binary that
    #      failed, so a red test hid its namesakes in other crates.
    #   3. A name shared by a runnable entry and a frozen one pulls the frozen
    #      one in — which is exactly the case now that `impact::` is frozen and
    #      `merge::` is not, both being `the_corpus_matches_the_prototype`.
    #
    # Asking cargo for the binaries and running each **by target** removes all
    # three: the target prefix in the inventory is what disambiguates, and it is
    # in the inventory precisely because these names collide. The count below
    # stays as the guard — one entry has to report exactly one result.
