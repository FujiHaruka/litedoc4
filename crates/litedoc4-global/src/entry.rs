//! The four pages a reader arrives at rather than navigates to.
//!
//! Milestone **M8-d**. Up to here the site had
//! **no entry at all**: `litedoc4 build` wrote 432 module pages and no
//! `index.html`, while every page's top bar linked to `index.html` and
//! `search.html` and every `Sort` in every signature linked to
//! `foundational_types.html` (`litedoc4_render::code`). Three dead links on all
//! 432 pages, and the deployed site's Search button was a 404 【実測 2026-08-16】.
//!
//! | | why it exists |
//! |---|---|
//! | `index.html` | the site's front door, and the `<noscript>` landing place the sidebar's fallback link points at (決定 4) |
//! | `404.html` | GitHub Pages serves it (`custom_404: true` 【実測】); `app.js` fills in the path and the near misses |
//! | `search.html` | where the top bar's form submits |
//! | `foundational_types.html` | `code.rs` links every `Sort` / `Type` / `Prop` here |
//!
//! # These are HTML built in the *global* crate, which looks like a layering
//! mistake
//!
//! It is not one. What decides a page's shape is [`litedoc4_render`] — the head,
//! the top bar, the class names, the stylesheet they are written against — and
//! all four of those come from there, unchanged. What decides a page's *content*
//! is a fact about the **whole package** (how many modules, which ones, how many
//! declarations), and the whole package is what this crate is. Putting them in
//! the renderer would mean handing the renderer the module list a second time,
//! from the other side of the pipeline.
//!
//! # No sidebar, and no repository link
//!
//! `topbar_html(root, site, false)` and `<body class="plain">`: these pages are
//! one column, and a drawer button that opens an empty drawer is worse than no
//! button. The hand-written preview (`design/preview/index.html`) also carries a
//! "repository" link in the module heading, and this does not — the repository
//! URL is `--source-url`, which reaches the renderer and not this crate, and a
//! second path for one anchor is not worth a knob that can be forgotten on one
//! of the two commands that build a site.

         <h2><code>Sort u</code></h2>\
         <p>The type of types, one level at a time. Every type in Lean belongs to some \
         <code>Sort u</code>, where the universe level <code>u</code> is a natural number or a \
         variable standing for one. A term of <code>Sort u</code> is itself a type, whose own \
         terms are the values.</p>\
         <p>The hierarchy is strict: <code>Sort u : Sort (u+1)</code>, and there is no \
         <code>Sort ∞</code>. That is what keeps the system consistent — a single type of all \
         types would contain itself.</p>\
         <h2><code>Prop</code></h2>\
         <p><code>Prop</code> is <code>Sort 0</code>, the sort of propositions. A term of a \
         proposition is a proof of it, and <code>Prop</code> is <em>proof-irrelevant</em>: any \
         two proofs of the same proposition are definitionally equal, so a proof can never be \
         inspected to produce data. This is why theorems can be erased at compile time and why \
         they are shown apart from definitions in this documentation.</p>\
         <h2><code>Type u</code></h2>\
         <p><code>Type u</code> abbreviates <code>Sort (u+1)</code>, and <code>Type</code> on its \
         own means <code>Type 0</code>. These are the sorts data lives in: <code>Nat</code>, \
         <code>List α</code> and every structure declared in this package are terms of some \
         <code>Type u</code>. Unlike <code>Prop</code>, distinct terms of a type stay \
         distinct.</p>\
         <h2>Dependent function types</h2>\
         <p><code>(x : α) → β x</code> is the type of functions whose <em>result type may \
         mention the argument</em>. When <code>β</code> does not use <code>x</code> it is written \
         <code>α → β</code>, the ordinary function type. Binders in the signatures on these pages \
         are the same thing in another spelling: <code>∀ (x : α), β x</code> is the dependent \
         function type when the result is a proposition, and <code>{x : α}</code> or \
         <code>[Inst α]</code> mark an argument the elaborator is expected to supply.</p>\
         <p>For the rules behind any of this, see Lean's own documentation — this page only \
         names the things a signature on this site can link to.</p>\
