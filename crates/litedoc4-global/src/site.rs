//! The run: an IR tree in, the whole-package artifacts out — plus, since M2-b,
//! the `contentHash` cache, the map delta and the timings record.
//!
//! Ported from `experiments/stage7h/global.ts:238-467` (frozen). The phases and
//! their boundaries are the prototype's, in its order:
//!
//! ```text
//! open index -> State::load -> facts_for -> derive+write files -> delta -> State::save -> timings
//!               t_state        t_read       t_write               t_delta   t_save
//! ```
//!
//! # The cache attaches at exactly one place
//!
//! [`facts_for`] is the only place a module's IR becomes [`ModuleFacts`], which
//! is why plan §3 asked for it before there was a cache to put in it. Its body
//! grew a hash test and its signature grew the cache and the hit/miss counts;
//! nothing downstream of [`ModuleFacts`] moved, and the artifacts were byte for
//! byte what M2-a produced. (M8-d changed *which* artifacts there are — see
//! [`crate::artifacts`] — but not this seam.)
//!
//! # Without `--state` this is still the from-scratch build
//!
//! Not a fallback — the program the prototype's own oracle compares the cached
//! run against, and it has to be the same program. `tests/state_and_delta.rs`
//! makes that comparison over seven IR states.
