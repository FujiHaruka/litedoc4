# What happens when a prebuilt `extract` meets the WRONG toolchain?
#
# ============================================================================
# WHY THIS DECIDES WHETHER A PREBUILT EXTRACTOR CAN BE SHIPPED
# ============================================================================
#   Shipping one binary per toolchain means users will eventually run one
#   against a toolchain it was not built for — a package bumps `lean-toolchain`
#   and a cache, a pinned action, or a stale download hands over yesterday's
#   binary. Two outcomes are acceptable and one is not:
#
#     it refuses to run          -> fine, the user sees an error and rebuilds
#     it runs and is correct     -> fine (and surprising)
#     it runs and writes an IR   -> NOT fine. Silent wrong output is worse than
#     that is subtly wrong          no distribution at all, because the docs
#                                   look built and nobody checks.
#
#   So this script's success condition is "it did NOT quietly succeed", and it
#   is red when the extractor comes back 0 while reading a foreign environment.
#
# ============================================================================
# WHY NO `lake build`, AND WHY THE MODULE IS `Init`
# ============================================================================
#   The module list names `Init`, which lives in the toolchain itself, so the
#   package needs no build output at all — only its `lean-toolchain` and enough
#   of a lakefile for `lake env` to resolve. That keeps this to an elan download
#   and seconds of work, and it puts the version skew exactly where it matters:
#   in the oleans `importModules` reads.
#
# usage:
#   extractor-mismatch.sh --extractor <bin> --package <dir> [--built-for <tc>]
#                         [--expect fail|any] [--json <path>]
#
#   --package     a Lean package whose lean-toolchain is NOT the one the
#                 extractor was built against (checked when --built-for is given)
