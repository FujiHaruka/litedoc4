# Is a rebuilt `.olean` byte-identical to the one it replaced?
#
# The incremental ledger keys a module on the SHA-256 of its `.olean`
# (`crates/litedoc4-incr/src/ledger.rs`). Every cache that crosses a machine, a
# CI run or a clean checkout therefore hits only if `lake build` reproduces the
# same bytes from the same source. That is an empirical property of Lean's
# serialisation, not something the ledger can assume, so this measures it.
#
# Per module, four hashes and three verdicts:
#
#   h0  the olean as found                     (the baseline)
#   h1  after deleting it and rebuilding       DETERMINISTIC  iff h1 == h0
#   h2  after appending a declaration          SENSITIVE      iff h2 != h1
#   h3  after restoring the source             REPRODUCIBLE   iff h3 == h1
#
# Both keys the ledger can be configured with are recorded at every point: the
# SHA-256 of the olean's bytes (`--algorithm sha256`) and the 64-bit hash Lake
# itself wrote to `<file>.olean.hash` (`--algorithm lake`). They can disagree —
# Lake's is a hash of the build's inputs, not of the output — and which one
# moves is the difference between "the cache misses" and "the cache is right".
#
# h2 is the positive control and it is not optional: without it "the bytes did
# not move" cannot be told apart from "nothing was rebuilt". A run where
# SENSITIVE fails says the measurement is blind, not that Lean is deterministic.
#
# The source edit is reverted from a saved copy and re-verified by hash; the
# target repository is never committed to. Only `.lake/build` is disturbed, and
# only for the modules named.
#
# usage: olean-determinism.sh --target <dir> --out <report> [--modules <a,b,..>]
#                             [--keep-going]
