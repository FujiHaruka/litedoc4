//! The IR's schema-5 shapes, as the extractor writes them.
//!
//! The authority for every field here is `experiments/stage7d/Extract.lean`
//! (`declToIrJson` / `writeIRTree`), not the TypeScript prototype: the writer is
//! what decides which keys exist and which are omitted. Where the prototype's
//! `render.ts` reads *fewer* fields than the writer emits, this module still
//! models the writer's — see the notes on [`IndexEntry::content_hash`] and
//! [`ModuleFile::tactics`], both of which other stages consume.
//!
//! Every struct is `deny_unknown_fields`. A field the extractor starts emitting
//! and this crate does not know about is then a loud parse failure instead of a
//! silent drop; the schema version is what governs compatibility, so there is no
//! forward-compatibility left for tolerant parsing to buy.
//!
//! Keys are alphabetically ordered on the wire (Lean's `Json.mkObj` is backed by
//! a sorted map). That matters for writing, which this crate does not do; for
//! reading it is irrelevant, and nothing here depends on field order.
