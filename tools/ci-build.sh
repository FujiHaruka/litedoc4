# Build a Lean package **and its documentation** in one job.
#
# Milestone **M6**. This is the body of the CI job; `.github/workflow-templates/
# litedoc4-docs.yml` is a wrapper that checks things out and calls this file.
#
# ============================================================================
# WHY THE COMMANDS ARE HERE AND NOT IN THE YAML
# ============================================================================
#   GitHub Actions cannot be run from where this was written (no runner, no
#   network), so a workflow that carried the commands inline would be a file
#   nobody had ever executed. Put the commands in a script and the workflow
#   shrinks to checkout + caches + one `run:` line: the interesting half can
#   then be run on a laptop, against a real package, and the untested remainder
#   is reduced to the actions themselves. What has NOT been executed is stated
#   in README.md and in the workflow's own header — it is not implied to work.
#
# ============================================================================
# WHY `lake build` AND THE DOCS ARE IN THE SAME JOB  【実測】
# ============================================================================
#   The extractor's floor is loading the Lean environment, and that cost is I/O,
#   not Lean: what decides it is whether the oleans are in the page cache. How
#   much a split job costs depends on the runner's memory, and the answer has
#   changed once already:
#
#     2 cores / 7.75 GiB (2026-08-10)  same job 2.61 s, split 20-89 s = 8-34x
#     4 cores / 15.6 GiB (2026-08-16)  same job 2.4-2.6 s, split 2.5-2.9 s
#                                      = **1.08-1.58x**, n=5, product end to end
#     same runner, cache dropped       13.5-22.3 s = **5.2-11.9x** (the control)
#
#   A separate "docs" job does NOT reliably start cold: it writes the oleans
#   itself, with `lake exe cache get` and whatever restores the package's build,
#   and on a runner with room they stay resident. The 8-34x was a consequence of
#   7.75 GiB, not of the split.
#
#   The placement is still the point of this script — `lake build` first, then
#   `litedoc4 build`, one job, one runner, one page cache — but for the reason
#   the control gives, not the one the first measurement suggested: **the cold
#   penalty is 5-12x, and whether a split job is cold depends on the runner's
#   RAM against the package's working set.** One job does not have to ask.
#
# ============================================================================
# HOW MATHLIB'S OLEANS ARE OBTAINED  — `lake exe cache get`, and why it is a flag
# ============================================================================
#   A Mathlib-dependent package does not compile Mathlib; it downloads the
#   prebuilt oleans with `lake exe cache get`. That needs the network, so it is
#   behind `--cache-get` rather than being unconditional:
#
#     * in CI it is what you want, and the workflow passes it;
#     * on a developer machine (and in this repository's own measurements) the
#       dependencies are already there, and an unconditional network call would
#       make a local run of "the CI command" not the same command;
#     * `~/.cache/mathlib` is what `actions/cache` should key on
#       `lake-manifest.json` — the download is the slow part, not the unpack.
#
#   A run without `--cache-get` says so in its log, with the reason. A silent
#   skip would be the failure mode where CI passes because the last run's
#   leftovers were still on disk.
#
# ============================================================================
# WHEN THE EXTRACTOR IS BUILT
# ============================================================================
#   `extractor/build.sh` compiles Extract.lean against **the package's own
#   toolchain** (`lake env` borrows it — litedoc4 has no toolchain and no Mathlib
#   of its own, CLAUDE.md; the root `lakefile.lean` deliberately has no
#   `lean-toolchain` beside it either). It therefore cannot be shipped as a
#   binary and cannot be built before the package's toolchain exists. It also
#   does not change between commits of the package, so in CI it belongs in a
#   cache keyed on `lean-toolchain` + the hash of `Extract.lean` — see the
#   workflow. Here: built if `--extractor-bin` is missing, skipped if present,
#   and either way the phase is timed and reported.
#
#   Cost, measured: **14.90 s wall / 10.07 s user, peak RSS 1.52 GB** on an
#   Apple M1 with a warm page cache 【実測 2026-08-15】. It is cached because it
#   does not change between commits, not because it is enormous — on a cold
#   runner the environment import inside it is the spread above, and that is the
#   part that is not measured here.
#
#   Same measurement, one thing worth knowing: built against a *different*
#   package (the same toolchain and the same `.lake/packages`), the binary came
#   out **byte for byte identical** (SHA-256 47f95072...). That is evidence for
#   the cache key, not proof of it: the two packages' dependency sets were
#   copies of each other.
#
# ============================================================================
# WHAT THIS NEVER DOES
# ============================================================================
#   It never writes inside `--root` beyond what `lake build` itself writes:
#   `--out` is refused by `litedoc4 build` if it is under `--root`, and this
#   script refuses it earlier so that the run stops before it has done anything.
#   The documentation tree is `<out>/site`; a caller who wants it inside the
#   repository copies it there.
#
# usage:
#   ci-build.sh --root <lean package> --out <dir> [options] [-- <build args>...]
#
#   --root <dir>            the Lean package to build and document (required)
#   --out <dir>             where the documentation state goes (required).
#                           <out>/site is the site; the rest is cache.
#   --cache-get             run `lake exe cache get` in --root first (network)
#   --no-lake-build         skip `lake build` — only for a caller that has
#                           already built the package **in the same job**
#   --jobs <n>              extractor threads (default 4)
#   --lake <path>           the lake executable (default: $LAKE, else `lake`)
#   --extractor-bin <path>  the Lean extractor (default: <repo>/extractor/build/
#                           extract, built by extractor/build.sh if missing)
#   --litedoc4-bin <path>   the litedoc4 binary (default: <repo>/target/release/
#                           litedoc4, built with cargo if missing)
#   --timings <file>        phase timings as one JSON object
#                           (default: <out>/ci-timings.json)
#   -- <args>...            passed through to `litedoc4 build` (e.g. --lib,
