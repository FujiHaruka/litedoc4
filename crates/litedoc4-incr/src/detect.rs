//! The `detect` stage: `build`, `check` and `touch`.
//!
//! Ported from `experiments/stage5/ledger.ts:216-422` (frozen). The three
//! commands are the whole of the input side of incrementality — which modules
//! must be re-extracted, answered **without starting Lean**.
//!
//! ```text
//! build  modules + target ──> ledger.json
//! check  ledger.json + the oleans as they are now
//!          ├─ extractKey diff ──> every module re-extracted
//!          ├─ per-module hash  ──> --changed-out   (changed ∪ added)
//!          ├─ module gone      ──> --removed-out
//!          └─ renderKey diff   ──> --render-all-out (one reason per line)
//! touch  ledger.json ──> the same ledger with one module's hash invalidated
//! ```
//!
//! # Why `touch` is in the product and not in a test
//!
//! It is the honest fake the whole stage-5 experiment rests on. The measurement
//! target must not be modified — its `.lake/build` is the baseline for every
//! number in this repository — so the *fact* "module M changed" is injected by
//! invalidating M's ledger entry. Everything downstream is real: the
//! re-extraction, the merge, the page set, the clocks. Without it the pipeline
//! cannot be exercised end to end on any repository somebody cares about.
//!
//! # The two sets are reported separately on purpose
//!
//! A changed `extractKey` invalidates every module's IR; a changed `renderKey`
//! invalidates **no** IR at all and is deliberately not folded into the
//! re-extract set. Computing the key diff and then not acting on it was the
//! whole failure of the prototype's S1.
