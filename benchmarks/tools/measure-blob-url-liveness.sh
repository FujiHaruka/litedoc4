# Check that version-pinned GitHub blob URLs actually resolve.

# Counterpart to `measure-docsite-drift.sh`: that one measures how much of the
# *public doc site* has drifted away from the version this project is pinned to;
# this one measures whether the version-pinned blob URLs emitted instead are
# live. The two share a rule — the product never does this at build time.
# Liveness is measured here, offline the rest of the time.
#
# Input is a file of URLs, one per line (e.g. cut out of a generated site, or out
# of the reference tree's oracle). A deterministic every-Nth sample is taken so a
# rerun checks the same URLs.
