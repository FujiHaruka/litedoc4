Those portions have been **changed** from the original: some were transcribed
verbatim, others were restructured to write an IR instead of HTML. The blocks
concerned are marked in place with the doc-gen4 source path they came from —
`isProjFn` / `isBlackListed`, the attribute stringifiers, `getInstanceTypes`,
`getInstPriority`, `getDefaultInstanceAttr`, `getFieldOrigin`, `mkTacticOut`,
the `Core.Context` options, `collectSpans`, the kind/modifier split, and
`structureMembers`. See `docs/provenance.md` for the full inventory.

litedoc4 as a whole is licensed separately; see this repository's LICENSE.
This binary does **not** link doc-gen4 — it imports only `Lean`.

Usage: extract <modules.txt> <out.jsonl> [options]
  --equations         generate equation lemmas (default: off)
  --write-ir          persist the result as one JSON file per module + an index
                      + a dependency-side map slice (default: off)
  --tagged-code       record, per printed fragment, the pre-order list of tag
                      spans `renderTagged` would produce, and add the declaration
                      range end / kind modifiers / in-module index to the IR
                      (default: off; bumps the IR schema version to 4)
  --no-attrs          ablation: skip the attribute collection
  --no-inst-index     ablation: skip the instance type index
  --no-member-extra   ablation: skip the structure members' binders / docstring /
                      origin
  --no-sorry          ablation: skip the `sorry` / `sorryAx` classification.
                      Any ablation marks the IR unrenderable.
  --ir-dir <path>     where to write it. **Required with `--write-ir`** and it
                      has no default (see `getIrDir`).
                      **Never point this inside the measurement target.**
  --dump <path>       write one JSON object per declaration to <path>
  --dump-modules <p>  write one JSON object per module (docs / imports / tactics)
  --only <path>       restrict processing to the declaration names in <path>
                      (one per line); for inspecting individual signatures
  --open <ns>[,<ns>]  pretty print with these namespaces opened
                      (probe for scoped notation; doc-gen4 opens nothing)
  --tag               additionally run `Widget.tagCodeInfos`, the step doc-gen4
                      needs to turn a signature into linkable `RenderedCode`
  --refs              collect the constants doc-gen4 would link from the
                      signature, the equations and the structure parent types
  --dump-refs <path>  write the unique set of those constants, one JSON object
                      per constant, with its defining module (needs --refs)
  --link-index <p>    also write the dependency closure's `name -> module` map
                      (`.lidx`) from the imported environment: the file the
                      renderer resolves docstring autolinks through
                      (see `writeLinkIndex`)
  --link-index-omit <p>  modules whose declaration groups are left out of that
                      map, one name per line. Their names stay in the `@`
                      section (see `writeLinkIndex`)
  --link-index-key <t>  an opaque token standing for everything about the map
                      that this process cannot see — the caller's `extractKey`
                      and the omit list. With it, a map whose sidecar
                      `<p>.key` holds the same token and whose `@` section is
                      still this environment's is left alone: no scan, no
                      write (see `writeLinkIndex`)
  --skip-analyze      skip the semantic analysis (module docs / tactics only)
  --tactics-emulate   additionally run the tactic collection doc-gen4's way
                      (`allTacticDocs` once per module) for comparison

/-! ## The dependency closure's `name -> module` map (`--link-index`)

The renderer resolves a docstring autolink the way doc-gen4's
`Output/DocString.lean:nameToLink?` does: it looks the token up in a global
`name -> module` map. doc-gen4 holds the whole environment and reads
`env.name2ModIdx`; the renderer holds none of it, so for it the map is an input
file — the `.lidx` read by `crates/litedoc4-render/src/link_index.rs`.

**What goes in is doc-gen4's choice, which is three predicates, not one:**

* `Process/Analyze.lean:195` walks `env.constants` and asks `DocInfo.ofConstant`,
  which drops the blacklisted (`isBlackListed`, transcribed above) and the
  recursors (`ConstantInfo.recInfo`);
* `Output/ToJson.lean:136` drops private names on the way into the JSON;
* the module of a name is `env.const2ModIdx` — that is literally what
  `Output/Base.lean:231`'s `declNameToLink` reads — and **not** the module whose
  `constNames` the name was reached through. The two disagree for the names that
  live in more than one module's olean (25 on the measurement target).

Walking modules instead of `env.constants` costs one extra hash lookup per name
and buys a deterministic order (`header.moduleNames`, i.e. import order), so two
runs of this produce byte-identical files.

**Escaping is not uniform, and that is copied rather than fixed**: declaration
names are `Name.toString` with escaping on, because that is what doc-gen4 writes
into the `.bmp`, while module names are written unescaped, because doc-gen4
builds the page path out of `Name.toString (escape := false)` components
(`Output/Base.lean:188`) and the renderer splits the module on `.` to rebuild
that path.

The file:

```text
#lidx2                                  the marker moves with the field count
Mathlib.Order.Basic                     a group header, unescaped
\tMathlib.Order.le_refl\t67\t67         name, first line, last line
\t<a name with no range>                a declaration with no range: one field
```

The range is `findDeclarationRanges?`'s `range.pos.line` and
`range.endPos.line`, which is what doc-gen4 builds its `#L<start>-L<end>` anchor
out of. A name a tab can never appear in is what makes the extra fields
unambiguous. **A declaration with no range keeps the one-field line**: dropping
it would lose the link entirely, where the missing range only costs the anchor.
Both counts are reported so that "no range" stays a number rather than a silence
— and on the measurement target that number is **0 of 255,975**
(measured 2026-08-16 → `benchmarks/results/m7a-summary.txt`).

### The package's own groups can be left out (`--link-index-omit`)

**The renderer never reads them.** A docstring token is resolved by
`NameIndex::module_of` (`crates/litedoc4-render/src/autolink.rs`), which asks the
IR-derived index *first* and only falls back to the `.lidx`; and the line range
this file carries is spent only where `ExternalLinks::url_for` has a root for the
module (`crates/litedoc4-render/src/external.rs`) — that is, only for a
**dependency**. Measured rather than believed: with all of the package's own
groups removed from the map, the rendered site is **byte-identical — 0 of 429
files differ**; the positive control, which removes the *dependency* half
instead, differs in **408 of 429** (measured 2026-08-17 →
`benchmarks/results/lidx-own-half-2026-08-17.txt`).

**Why leave them out, given that they are only 3.6% of the file.** Because they
are the only part of it that moves when a module of the package is edited, and
the map's SHA-256 is part of the renderer's `renderKey`: one added declaration
moves the map, the key moves with it, and all 422 pages re-render for an edit
that touched one.

**The `@` section stays complete — omitted modules included.** It answers a
different question: `module_for_source_path` scans `known_modules` linearly for a
docstring source path and answers `None` when **two** entries match, so taking an
entry out can turn a `None` into a `Some` — a link that did not exist before,
possibly to a page this run did not write.

**What is left out is counted, not merely absent** (`omitted`,
`omittedDeclarations`). An omitted module is walked exactly as it would be
otherwise and only its *output* is dropped, which makes both counts exact and
leaves two invariants a reader can check against a run without the flag:
`modules + omitted` and `declarations + omittedDeclarations` are that run's
`modules` and `declarations`, and `scanned` does not move at all. The saving that
is given up by still walking them is ~3.6% of a 0.9 s phase; a silent omission is
the failure mode this project keeps catching, and it is not worth 30 ms.

### A map that is already right is not rewritten (`--link-index-key`)

Rewriting on every extraction request is 490,287 constants walked and 10 MB
written, **1.20-1.81 s** of a 6.2 s one-module incremental build
(measured 2026-08-17 → `benchmarks/results/g3-stage-c-2026-08-17.txt`). The file
it produces is a function of exactly three things:

1. **the set of modules in the imported environment** (`env.header.moduleNames`),
   which decides both the `@` section and which oleans are walked;
2. **the contents of those modules' oleans**, which decide the names and their
   line ranges;
3. **the omit list**, which decides whose groups are dropped.

Only (1) is something this process can read cheaply. (2) would mean hashing the
dependency closure's oleans, which is most of the cost this is trying to avoid,
and (3) is the caller's own input. So (2) and (3) are delegated to **one opaque
token** (`--link-index-key`) that the caller promises moves whenever either of
them does, and this process checks (1) itself.

**The token goes in a sidecar `<path>.key`, not in a `#` header line of the
map** — and that is not a style choice. The map's SHA-256 is an input to the
renderer's `renderKey`, so anything written *into* the file re-renders every page
when it changes. Folding the caller's key in would tie every toolchain bump to a
full re-render of a map whose content did not move.

**The `@`-section comparison is not redundant with the token, in either
direction.** The token cannot see the closure: a package that adds
`import Mathlib.NewThing` pulls in modules whose declarations belong in the map,
and neither `lean-toolchain` nor `lake-manifest.json` moves for it — the token
would still match while the map is short. Conversely the `@` section cannot see
the oleans: the same module list can be built from a different Mathlib. So
**both** are required, compared **in order and in count** (a prefix match would
accept a truncated map, and equal counts with a reordered list would accept a map
written under a different import order).

**The failure direction is: any doubt rewrites.** No token, no sidecar, an
unreadable sidecar, a token that differs, a count that differs, one name that
differs — every one of them falls through to the full walk and a full write.
Being wrong here means serving a stale map, which is silent; being conservative
costs 1.2 s. And when no token is supplied at all, a stale `<path>.key` left by an
earlier run is **deleted**, so a later run with a token cannot match a sidecar
that describes a map this run has since overwritten. -/

/-- The marker `writeLinkIndex` puts on the first line, and the one the reuse

**One definition for both**: the caller's token covers the oleans and the omit

field count, so a writer that changes the format changes this string in the same
edit and every map written before it stops being reusable on the next run. -/

section is written first, so this touches the head of a 10 MB file rather than
the whole of it. `#` lines are skipped because the format marker is one, so a
future comment line must not be read as the end of the section.

The comparison is **in order and in count**: order matters because the map's
group order is `modNames`'s order, count matters because a prefix would otherwise
pass. Module names are compared against `toString (escape := false)`, which is
how `writeLinkIndex` spells them. -/

**Three** things have to hold: the caller's token, which covers the oleans and
the omit list; the `@` section, which covers the module set (neither implies the
other); and `linkIndexMarker`, which covers **this file's own format** — the one
input neither of the other two can see. Everything that is not a clear "yes"
answers `false`: a missing map, a missing or unreadable sidecar, a token that
differs by one byte, a section that differs by one name, a marker from an older
format. Rewriting when it was not needed costs 1.2 s; not rewriting when it was
needed serves a stale map, silently.

`DocGen4/Process/Attributes.lean`. doc-gen4 calls it from `Info.ofTypedName` for
**every** declaration and prints the result as one `div.attributes` line.

Transcribed, not imported: `import Lean` is this extractor's only dependency. The
four lists and the composition order (`customs ++ tags ++ enums ++ parametric`)
are doc-gen4's — the order is what the printed string looks like, so it is part
of the specification, not a detail. doc-gen4 routes the value-carrying attributes
through a `ValueAttr` type class so that one loop can serve both `EnumAttributes`
and `ParametricAttribute`; the lists have 1 and 5 entries, so the loop is written
out instead. What has to stay identical is the strings and their order.

**The name and the value are separate.** doc-gen4 concatenates them —
`parametricGetValue` returns `<attribute name> <value>` as one string. The split
happens at **this** end because this is the only end that knows where the
boundary is: an attribute value can contain spaces (`deprecated`) and brackets
(`specialize`), so a reader given the concatenation would have to guess, and a
guess made downstream is a second answer to a question already answered here.
Every collector below therefore returns `Array (String × String)`; a tag
attribute has no value and carries `""`.

/-- doc-gen4's `customAttrs` (`hasSimp`, `hasCsimp`, `getReducibility`) in order.
`semireducible` is the default and is deliberately not printed.

The reducibility name comes from Lean's own `ReducibilityStatus.toAttrString`
rather than from a constructor-by-constructor `match`, which is where doc-gen4
spells it out. **Lean v4.33.0 added `instanceReducible` to the inductive**: an
exhaustive `match` over the four older constructors stops compiling the moment a
fifth appears, and one carrying `| _ => pure ()` would compile and silently drop
the new attribute from the IR instead. Deriving the string keeps a single source
building on v4.31 through v4.33 *and* keeps a constructor nobody here has heard
of in the output; the strings are unchanged for the four that existed before, so
the IR does not move — 436 of 436 files byte identical over the measurement
target, with 75 declarations actually taking this branch
(→ `benchmarks/results/lean-433-fix-2026-08-18.txt`).

What is not derivable is the bracketing, so that is asserted rather than assumed:
if `toAttrString` ever stops returning `[name]` this throws instead of writing a
mangled attribute — which, like every other `throwError` in the analysis loop,
costs the declaration and lands in the `failures` report rather than failing the
process. The slicing is spelled `drop`/`dropEnd`/`toString` because that is what
compiles warning-free on all three toolchains: `String.drop` returns a
`String.Slice` here, `Slice.dropRight` is deprecated in favour of `dropEnd`, and
`String.mk` in favour of `ofList`. -/

`DocGen4/Process/InstanceInfo.lean`. Two different things live here:

* two **attributes** that only instances get — `instance <priority>` when the
  priority is not the default 1000, and `defaultInstance <priority>` — appended
  *after* `getAllAttributes`, so the order matters for the printed string;
* the **type index**: the class name and the head symbols of the instance's
  arguments. Those never reach a module page — the browser fills the "Instances"
  lists from `declarations/declaration-data.bmp`.

/-! ## Referenced constants — the demand side of the link map

doc-gen4 turns a `Format` into linkable `RenderedCode` in two steps:
`Widget.tagCodeInfos` (Lean core) wraps every tag position in a `SubexprInfo`,
and doc-gen4's own `renderTagged` (`DocGen4/RenderedCode.lean`) decides which of
them become `<a href>`. Only the second step names constants.
-/

structure RefAcc where
  /-- Every occurrence, not a set: deduplication happens in the driver. -/
  names : Array Name := #[]
  nanos : Nat := 0
  deriving Inhabited

/--
The names doc-gen4's `renderTagged` tags as `.const`, i.e. exactly the ones that
become links in its HTML.

`renderTagged` matches `.tag i t` where `i.info.val.info` is
`Elab.Info.ofTermInfo ti` and `ti.expr.consumeMData` is `.const c _`. The same
test is done directly against `infos`, skipping `Widget.tagCodeInfos`: the only
thing that step adds is a `WithRpcRef.mk` per tag (an `IO.Ref` allocation for the
RPC layer), which cannot change which names come out.

`Elab.Info.ofFieldInfo` and `.ofDelabTermInfo` carry constants too, but
`renderTagged` only matches `.ofTermInfo`, so those are not links in doc-gen4's
output and are not collected here either — likely a doc-gen4 oversight,
reproduced on purpose. `Expr.sort` gets its own (non-constant) tag and every
other `Expr` head falls through to `.otherExpr`; neither yields a name.

Walking *every* tag is equivalent to `renderTagged`'s recursion: it descends into
the subtree of a `.const` tag whenever that subtree is not a bare `.text`, and a
bare `.text` subtree carries no tags at all.

/-! ### Positional tags — the same walk, keeping the offsets

`collectConsts` above throws the positions away. `collectSpans` below does not:
it is the same traversal, but every tag that survives into doc-gen4's HTML comes
out as a half-open interval over the fragment's **plain text**, in pre-order.

Offsets are in **UTF-16 code units**, not characters and not UTF-8 bytes: the
consumer is a `String`-slicing runtime and this is the unit that makes
`s.slice(start, stop)` correct there without a conversion pass. Lean's own
`String.length` is code points, so nothing here may use it.
-/

@[inline] def charUtf16 (c : Char) : Nat := if c.val < 0x10000 then 1 else 2

def utf16Len (s : String) : Nat :=
  String.foldl (fun n c => n + charUtf16 c) 0 s

/--
One tag position over a printed fragment: `[start, stop)` in UTF-16 code units.

`kind` is exactly the three `RenderedCode.Tag`s that reach doc-gen4's HTML as an
element (`DocGen4/Output/Base.lean:334-389`):

| kind | tag | element |
|---|---|---|
| 0 | `.otherExpr` | `<span class="fn">` |
| 1 | `.const name` | `<a href="…#name">`, or `<span class="fn">` when the name is not linkable |
| 2 | `.sort _` | `<a href="…foundational_types.html">` |

`.keyword` and `.string` are deliberately absent: `renderedCodeToHtmlAux` renders
both as plain content, so they produce no element and no bytes.
-/
structure Span where
  start : Nat
  stop : Nat
  kind : Nat
  /-- Only meaningful for `kind = 1`. -/
  name : Name := .anonymous
  /-- Width, in UTF-16 code units, of the whitespace `splitWhitespaces` cut off
  the **front** of this tag's bare text — the units `[start - front, start)`.
  doc-gen4 re-emits that run as plain spaces, so a consumer that does not know
  the width cannot tell a rebuilt `' '` from the pretty printer's original
  `'\n'`. Zero for every span that is not the `kind = 1` bare-text case. -/
  front : Nat := 0
  /-- Same for the **back**: the units `[stop, stop + back)`. -/
  back : Nat := 0
  deriving Inhabited

/--
doc-gen4's `splitWhitespaces` (`DocGen4/RenderedCode.lean:150-157`) in offset
form: a `.const` tag whose body is bare text links only the trimmed token, the
surrounding whitespace stays outside the `<a>`.

Returns `(leading whitespace, total UTF-16 width, trailing whitespace)`. Both
whitespace counts are ASCII, so characters and UTF-16 units coincide there. The
all-whitespace case matches doc-gen4's: `trimAsciiStart` empties the string first,
so `back` is 0 and the (empty) anchor lands at the end.
-/
def wsTrim (s : String) : Nat × Nat × Nat :=
  let r := String.foldl
    (fun (acc : Nat × Nat × Nat × Bool) c =>
      let (front, total, back, leading) := acc

      else
        (front, total + charUtf16 c, 0, false))
    (0, 0, 0, true) s
  let (front, total, back, _) := r
  (front, total, if front == total then 0 else back)

/-- doc-gen4's sort split (`DocGen4/RenderedCode.lean:258-269`): when a `.sort`
tag's body is bare text, only the part before the first space (`Type` / `Prop` /
`Sort`) is inside the link; the universe that follows is not. -/
def sortPrefixLen (s : String) : Nat :=
  (String.foldl
    (fun (acc : Nat × Bool) c =>
      let (n, done) := acc
      if done || c == ' ' then (n, true) else (n + charUtf16 c, false))
    (0, false) s).1

/--
The pre-order span list of one formatted fragment.

Node for node the same walk as `renderTagged`
(`DocGen4/RenderedCode.lean:240-274`) composed with `Widget.tagCodeInfos`:

* a tag position that is not in `infos` is **dropped** by `tagCodeInfos`, so
  `renderTagged` never sees it and no span is emitted — the subtree is still
  walked;
* `.ofTermInfo` whose expression is `.const c _` -> kind 1, `.sort _` -> kind 2,
  anything else -> kind 0; any other `Elab.Info` -> kind 0. This reproduces
  doc-gen4, including its blind spot for `.ofFieldInfo` / `.ofDelabTermInfo`
  (see `collectConsts`);
* the two bare-text special cases (`wsTrim`, `sortPrefixLen`) narrow the span the
  way `renderTagged` narrows the tag.

**Pre-order, parent before child, outer before inner at equal offsets.** That
ordering is the whole nesting rule: a consumer replays the list on a stack and
closes a span when the next one starts beyond its `stop`. The parent's slot is
therefore reserved *before* its subtree is walked and patched afterwards.

the steps the Lean pretty printer actually goes through, which are the same ones

         --format--> Format --pretty--> String

`--tagged-code`'s span collection is *not* in here: it already has its own
counter (`refUs`), and it runs after `pretty` on the same `Format`.

The probe is `none` unless `--pp-breakdown`, and then every site is one `Option`

/-- The declaration `@[ext]` realized `name` *from*, or nothing.

**This is the only origin litedoc4 emits**, and not because the others are
uninteresting: `simps` / `to_additive` / `mk_iff` / `to_dual` / `alias` keep
their maps in **Mathlib's** environment extensions, and an extractor that imports
Mathlib stops building against a Mathlib-free package — which is the one thing
`e2e/micro` and its CI gate exist to keep working. `extExtension` is in Lean
core.

Two conditions, and **both are load-bearing**:

* **The name has one of the two shapes core builds, and the environment agrees.**
  `realizeExtTheorem` names its theorem `structName ++ "ext"` and refuses to run
  unless `isStructure structName`; `realizeExtIffTheorem` names its theorem
  `extName ++ "_iff"` (`Lean/Elab/Tactic/Ext.lean:107,142`).
* **`selectionRange == range`.** Being in the extension is *not* the same as
  being generated: `@[ext] theorem MulHom.ext` is hand written and is in the
  extension. A hand-written declaration has a `declId` for the elaborator to
  record as its selection range, so the two ranges differ; a realized one is
  positioned by `addDeclarationRangesFromSyntax name (← getRef)` with no
  selection syntax at all, and `Lean/Elab/DeclarationRange.lean:53` then defaults
  `selectionRange` to `range`.

What comes back is the declaration the realization **took as input, one step**:
`P.ext` came from the structure `P`, `P.ext_iff` came from `P.ext`. Collapsing
`P.ext_iff` onto `P` would make it claim a structure as its origin in the case
where `P.ext` is hand written, which is precisely the case the second condition
exists to keep apart.

**`selectionRange == range` on its own is not "generated"** and must not be used
as if it were (measured 2026-08-21 →
`benchmarks/results/generated-decls-2026-08-21.txt`): over 2,786 Mathlib
declarations it also fires on structure and class field projections and on
macro-defined declarations, and it does *not* fire on the `to_additive` twins
whose additive name the author wrote out. It is a necessary condition here,
joined to a name the environment can confirm. -/

The words doc-gen4's `getKindDescription`
(`DocGen4/Process/DocInfo.lean:211-247`) puts in front of the kind word, as
flags. The composition rule is doc-gen4's, and the consumer has to reapply it:

| `kind` | `span.decl_kind` |
|---|---|
| `definition` | `unsafe`? `noncomputable`? then `abbrev` if present else `def` |
| `instance` | `unsafe`? `noncomputable`? then `instance` |
| `axiom` | `unsafe`? then `axiom` |
| `opaque` | `partial def` if `partial`, else `unsafe opaque` if `unsafe`, else `opaque` |
| `inductive` | `unsafe`? then `inductive` |
| everything else | the kind word alone |

Nothing is emitted for a theorem, even when it is an instance
(`InstanceInfo.ofTheoremVal` hard-codes both flags false), and nothing for
`structure` / `class` / `class inductive`, whose `getKindDescription` branches
ignore `isUnsafe`.

/-! ## `sorry` / `sorryAx` — doc-gen4 issue #270

**Two claims, not one.** "This proof is a hole" and "something underneath this
proof is a hole" are read differently, so the IR carries `"direct"` or
`"transitive"` and omits the key when neither holds. It does **not** carry the
axiom set: every Mathlib-dependent declaration transitively uses
`Classical.choice` / `propext` / `Quot.sound`, so the full list is a large field
with almost no information in it.

**`Lean.collectAxioms` is not the closure walk it reads like.** Lean keeps a
`PersistentEnvExtension` (`Lean/Util/CollectAxioms.lean`, `exportedAxiomsExt`)
whose per-declaration axiom arrays are computed when a module's olean is
*written*; for an **imported** constant `collectAxioms` is a binary search in
that module's entry array and walks no expression at all. Everything this
extractor analyzes is imported, so the memo a per-declaration closure walk would
need has already been paid, once, by whoever built the oleans. Byte-identical in
v4.31.0 / v4.32.2 / v4.33.0.

**The direct half is the part that walks expressions, so it is only asked when
the answer can be `"direct"`.** A declaration whose axiom array has no `sorryAx`
cannot be either value and is answered by the binary search alone; the cost of
the whole feature therefore scales with the number of *tainted* declarations,
not with the package.
-/

/-- Does this declaration's **own** statement or proof mention `sorryAx`?

`Expr.foldConsts` rather than `ConstantInfo.getUsedConstantsAsSet`: the question
is a membership test rather than a set, and that function folds an inductive's
constructors into its answer — which would make a type whose *constructor* is
`sorry`'d claim the `sorry` as its own. -/
def mentionsSorryAx (ci : ConstantInfo) : Bool :=
  let has (e : Expr) : Bool := e.foldConsts false fun c acc => acc || c == ``sorryAx
  has ci.type ||
    match ci.value? (allowOpaque := true) with
    | some v => has v
    | none => false

/-- `"direct"`, `"transitive"`, or nothing.

A declaration that is both is `"direct"`: it is the stronger claim and the one a
reader acts on. The fallthrough for a name the environment cannot find is
`"transitive"` rather than `"direct"` for the same reason — `collectAxioms` has
already said `sorryAx` is down there, and claiming the hole is *here* without
having seen the term would be the stronger claim made on no evidence. -/

/-! ## Module docs and tactics — doc-gen4's `getAllModuleDocs`, restructured

doc-gen4 (`DocGen4/Process/Analyze.lean`) loops over the relevant modules and
calls `collectTactics module env` for each one; `collectTactics` calls
`Elab.Tactic.Doc.allTacticDocs`, which rebuilds the *whole* environment's tactic
table from the parser tables, and then throws away everything not defined in
`module`. That is 432 rebuilds of the same table. Here the table is built once
and bucketed by defining module.

/-! ## IR persistence (`--write-ir`)

The granularity is the module, so the layout is

```
<irDir>/index.json                     package index: module list, hash, path
<irDir>/modules/<Module.Name>.json     one file per module (the IR proper)
<irDir>/deps/<Root>.json               dependency-side map slice, one per package
```

Three properties are deliberate:

* **Absolute identifiers only.** A reference is a `(defining module, name)` pair.
  No URL — relative or absolute — is stored; relativisation happens at output
  time.
* **The dependency slice is two columns** (name -> module) and covers only the
  constants this package actually refers to.
* **Every module carries a content hash**, the single source of truth for "what
  has to be re-extracted / re-rendered".
-/

/-- Schema version of the on-disk IR. Part of every module file, therefore part
of every module hash: a schema change invalidates the cache. The flag picks the
version rather than always bumping it.

Schema 5 adds `sorry`, whose *absent* key means "no sorry" — a meaning a
schema-4 file cannot carry, since there the key could not exist. The reading side
keeps the two apart with `ModuleFile::sorry_of`, which answers `Unknown` below
schema 5. Nothing has to migrate: the extract key carries `irSchemaVersion`, so a
bump re-extracts.

**Not every change to what is written moves this number.** `attrs` elements
became `[name, value]` arrays where schema 4 had one concatenated string, and
`selectionRange` and `generated` were added, all under the same 5;
`litedoc4-incr`'s `EXTRACTOR_ID` is what carries those, and the reader accepts
both `attrs` shapes because a schema-4 file is still readable and still says `4`.
`selectionRange` costs **+0.96%** of the IR on the measurement target
(measured → `benchmarks/results/generated-decls-2026-08-21.txt`) and is written for
every declaration of a tagged file on purpose — an omission rule would give its
absence two meanings. -/

report success, and an environment variable left over from another run can
redirect a command line that looks complete.

`parseArgs` rejects `--write-ir` without `--ir-dir`, so this is total in

**This is a 64-bit non-cryptographic hash**, not SHA-256: Lean core ships no
digest, and pulling one in would put an unrelated implementation inside a number
this is trying to measure. For 432 modules the collision probability is ~5e-15,
which is fine for change detection; it is *not* fine as a tamper-evident content
address. `lean_string_hash` is also only stable within a Lean version, which is
harmless because the Lean version is already in the cache key. -/

/-- One span as it goes on the wire.

A `kind = 1` span whose tag text had leading or trailing whitespace is written as
`[start, stop, 1, name, front, back]`. Without those two the consumer cannot
reproduce `splitWhitespaces`, which **rewrites that whitespace as spaces**
(`Base.lean:281-288`, `"".pushn ' ' n`) — same width, different characters. The
pair is emitted only when at least one of the two is non-zero, so the cost falls
on the fragments that need it rather than on every span. -/

/-- One process, many extractions.

The environment load is the extraction's fixed cost (~3.1 s warm) and it is paid
per *process*, so anything that runs the extractor more than once per edit pays
it more than once.

The import list is the **superset**: whatever `<modules.txt>` names, typically the
whole package. Requests then extract subsets of it. That is the right direction
for soundness — a single-module target list can leave the environment too
*small* (measured for `--open`), and a resident process's environment is never
smaller than the one-shot's.

**What this deliberately does not do is reload.** An olean that changed on disk
after the import is not picked up: Lean has no way to swap one module out of an
imported environment. So a resident server is only valid for re-extracting
modules whose *own* olean has not changed — and exactly not the module the user
just edited. The protocol makes that explicit by refusing nothing and reporting
everything: the caller decides.

Protocol, one request per line on stdin, tab- or space-separated:

    <modules.txt> <out.jsonl> [<ir-dir>]

and one reply line per request on stdout: `ok <exit code> <nanoseconds>`.
