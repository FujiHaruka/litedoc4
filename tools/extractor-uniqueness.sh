# Is `extract` decided by the toolchain alone, or also by the target package's
# dependency set?  (docs/plans/distribution.md, checks X1 / X3)
#
# ============================================================================
# WHY THIS QUESTION IS WORTH A SCRIPT
# ============================================================================
#   If the answer is "the toolchain alone", one prebuilt extractor can be
#   shipped per toolchain and every user's CI stops spending ~16 s building it.
#   If it is not, the binary cannot be shipped at all and the CI cache is the
#   only option. `tools/ci-build.sh` already reported a byte-for-byte match
#   across two packages, and says in the same breath why that was weak evidence:
#   the two dependency sets were copies of each other. This script exists to be
#   run over packages that are *not* copies of each other.
#
# ============================================================================
# WHY NO `lake build`
# ============================================================================
#   `extractor/Extract.lean` imports only `Lean`. The target package is borrowed
#   for its environment (`lake env` sets LEAN_PATH and picks the toolchain), not
#   for its build output, so a package that has never been built works here.
#   Building would also be the slow, disk-hungry part — CLAUDE.md's disk rule.
#
# ============================================================================
# WHAT IS COMPARED, AND WHAT IS NOT
# ============================================================================
#   The SHA-256 of the binary and of the C that `lean` emits on the way. The
#   binaries are NOT kept side by side: `extractor/build.sh` writes to a fixed
#   path, so this builds, hashes, and moves on. That keeps peak disk at one
#   copy (171 MB) instead of one per package. `--keep-binary` saves exactly one
#   for a caller that wants to ship or upload it.
#
#   NOT compared: the IR two binaries produce. Once the binaries are identical
#   that question is answered; when they are NOT identical this script fails and
#   the IR comparison is the follow-up, not a substitute.
#
# usage:
#   extractor-uniqueness.sh <package> <package> [<package>...]
#                           [--keep-binary <path>] [--json <path>]
