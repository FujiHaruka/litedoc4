//! Reads the real `.lidx` of the target package's dependency closure.
//!
//! ~10 MB, written by `litedoc4 build` itself. It lives outside the repository,
//! so this test is `#[ignore]`d rather than silently skipped: `cargo test` has
//! to pass on a machine that has never run the pipeline, and a run that reports
//! it as ignored says out loud that it did not run.
//!
//! # What it checks — the reader against the writer, on real data
//!
//! The format marker; that every entry resolves and no module name leaked into
//! the entry table; and — read out of the **text**, not out of this reader — the
//! last entry with the group header above it, and a module that is a link target
//! in its own right.
//!
//! # What it stopped checking【判断 2026-08-16】
//!
//! Four counts the **prototype's** reader measured over the **prototype's**
//! `.lidx`: 258,760 entries / 8,494,819 UTF-16 code units / 5,775 modules /
//! 6,115 `@` names (`benchmarks/results/stage7c-render-timings.jsonl`).
//!
//! **The question stopped being askable, and not because the numbers were lost.**
//! That file was derived from Mathlib's `declaration-data.bmp` by
//! `experiments/stage7d/build-link-index.ts`, which left with `experiments/`
//! (tag `experiments-frozen`). The product derives the same map **by walking the
//! environment** instead (V1, M5-a) — a different construction, so a different
//! tally: **255,809 entries over the same target**【実測 2026-08-16】. Holding a
//! walk-derived map to a bmp-derived count was never the same question; keeping
//! it only meant the test ran on a file nobody can rebuild, which is where the
//! four counts had already left it (the default path was empty, so the gate read
//! this as "no input").
