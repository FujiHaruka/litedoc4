//! Opening an IR tree and reading files out of it.
//!
//! [`IrTree::module`] is the single funnel every module read goes through —
//! including the ones [`IrTree::modules`] and [`IrTree::load_modules`] make.
//! That is the structural constraint plan §3 asks for: the incremental pipeline
//! still reads the whole IR five times, and the `contentHash` cache that would
//! remove four of them has exactly one place to go. The cache itself is not
//! here yet — it is performance, not correctness, and gate A does not include
//! it — but nothing else has to move when it arrives.

/// The schema this reader understands. Schema 3 has no attributes, no instance
/// index and no member binders / docstrings / origin, so a schema-3 IR cannot
/// produce a byte-identical page.
///
/// **It moved to 5 in feature-sweep C-4** (`docs/plans/feature-sweep.md`), and
/// what that buys is one meaning per absence. Schema 5 adds `sorry`,
/// `selectionRange` and `generated`, and for each of them an *absent* key says
/// something — "no `sorry`", "not realized by an attribute" — that a schema-4
/// file cannot say, because there the key could not exist. While the floor was
/// 4 the two states had to be kept apart at every read;
/// [`crate::ModuleFile::sorry_of`] is what did it, and it is still the only way
