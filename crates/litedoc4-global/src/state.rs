//! The `contentHash` cache: `--state <dir>` keeps `<dir>/global-state.json`.
//!
//! Ported from `experiments/stage7h/global.ts:127-229` (frozen). Milestone
//! **M2-b**: the goal was the cache version key plus the test that breaks it,
//! rather than the cache implementation itself.
//!
//! ```text
//! index.json ──┬─> State::load ──> facts_for ──> [ModuleFacts] ──> State::save
//!              └─ contentHash: the only thing a hit is decided on
//! ```
//!
//! # The key is the IR's own hash, not the caller's idea of what changed
//!
//! A driver that passes a wrong changed-set cannot corrupt this cache: an entry
//! is used iff its `contentHash` equals the one `index.json` carries now. A
//! stale entry needs the extractor to emit the same hash for different bytes,
//! which is the assumption the whole incremental pipeline already makes.
//!
//! # Everything that can go wrong loads as "empty"
//!
//! [`State::load`] returns an empty cache when the file is missing, when it does
//! not parse, and when any of the four version keys disagrees with the index. It
//! says nothing on the way out. That is the prototype's behaviour and this is a
//! port: a cold cache is the normal first run, and a `--state` directory that
//! has been left behind by another tool is not an error the caller can act on —
//! the only correct response is to rebuild, which is what happens. The cost of
//! being wrong here is time; the cost of trusting a foreign entry is a wrong
//! artifact that nobody reports.
