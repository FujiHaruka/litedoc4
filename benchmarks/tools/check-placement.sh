# Check a placement A/B measurement before anyone reads its numbers.
#
# The measurement it guards is `.github/workflows/ci-placement.yml`: the same
# documentation build run in the SAME job as `lake build` (arm `same`) and in a
# SEPARATE job (arm `split`). Green steps are not what makes such a run worth
# reading — a measurement that silently ran four times instead of ten is green.
# What makes it readable is that
#
#   1. every run the workflow SAID it would do reported a result, and no result
#      appeared that was never declared (both directions), and
#   2. the two arms did the SAME WORK: placement is supposed to change the
#      clock, not the bytes. Two clean builds of the measurement target produce
#      a byte-identical site 【実測 2026-08-17: 432 files, digest faf6d6c9…】,
#      so a digest that differs between runs means the arms are not comparable
#      and the ratio between them means nothing.
#
# The inventory is written BEFORE the runs, so a run that dies takes the check
# down with it instead of shrinking the denominator.
#
# usage:
#   check-placement.sh <results-dir>
#
#   <results-dir>/runs.txt              the inventory: one "<arm> <index>" per
#                                       intended run, written before running
#   <results-dir>/timings-<arm>-<i>.json   ci-build.sh --timings for that run
#   <results-dir>/site-<arm>-<i>.sha256    digest of that run's site tree
#   <results-dir>/time-<arm>-<i>.txt       that run's log, which must carry the
#                                          extractor server's `ready <ns>` line
#
# exit 0 when every declared run reported and all digests agree; 1 otherwise,
# with one line per violation.
