//! `litedoc4 incremental` — the pipeline that sequences the six Rust stages, and
//! `litedoc4 modules` — the source glob its `--modules` list comes from.
//!
//! Milestone **M3-d2**. Ported from `experiments/stage7h/incremental.sh` (441
//! lines, frozen). This is the last piece of the incremental path: every stage
//! it drives already lives in a library, so what moves here is **the ordering,
//! the round loop and the union of the two render-set derivations** — the three
//! things that belong to no stage.
//!
//! ```text
//!  1 detect     litedoc4_incr::check_ledger      changed / removed / render-all
//!  2 extract    --extractor <program>            the only external process
//!  3 ownership  litedoc4_incr::ownership   ┐ L3-1: who points at a name that moved
//!  4 merge      litedoc4_incr::merge       ┘ rounds, bounded by --max-rounds
//!  5 prune      litedoc4_incr::prune             the deleted modules' pages
//!  6 global     litedoc4_global::build_global    six artifacts + the map delta
//!  7 render     litedoc4_render::render_site     the union of the two sets
//! ```
//!
//! **The stages are library calls, not subprocesses.** `litedoc4` never
//! re-invokes itself: a pipeline made of processes would have to serialise every
//! intermediate answer through a file, and two of the files the prototype used
//! that way are exactly where it loses data (see "the prototype's hole" below).
//! The one external process is the extractor, because it is Lean.
//!
//! # The six ordering constraints, all measured (plan §6)
//!
//! 1. **`ownership` before `merge`** — merge overwrites the base IR's idea of who
//!    owns each name, which is ownership's only input.
//! 2. **`global` before `impact`** — the whole-package map delta is half of the
//!    render set, and `impact` does not take it as an input.
//! 3. **extract → ownership → merge is a loop**, bounded by `--max-rounds`
//!    (default 5); the bound reached with modules still stale is **exit 5**.
//! 4. **A moved `renderKey` overrides `--mode` with `all`** — the one page set
//!    that does not follow from any changed module.
//! 5. **An empty regeneration set skips the renderer.** In the prototype this was
//!    a *correctness* guard; here it is only an optimisation — see below.
//! 6. **`--jobs` is the resident extractor's start-time configuration**
//!    (`Extract.lean:2751`), so it is a flag of this command **only with
//!    `--serve`** — which is exactly when this command is the thing that starts
//!    the server. Behind `--extractor` the parallelism belongs to the extraction
//!    program and reaches it through `--extractor-arg --jobs --extractor-arg 4`
//!    like any other of its settings.
//!
//! # Residency (M4-c)
//!
//! `--serve` replaces `--extractor` with **one Lean environment for the whole
//! run**: imported at the first round that has something to extract, asked by
//! every round after it, released on the way out of the loop. There is no
//! `--serve-dir` and no `--serve-from`; [`crate::resident`] carries the whole of
//! why — correctness comes from the server's olean generation and never from the
//! round number 【実測, stage 6a】, so a server this process did not start is one
//! it cannot vouch for, and the generation it *can* vouch for is checked rather
//! than argued.
//!
//! # Constraint 5 is a type here, not a guard
//!
//! `render.ts` treats "no `--only`" as "every module", so the prototype had to
//! test the set in shell before calling it (`incremental.sh:367`) — one `if` in
//! one script standing between an empty regeneration set, which is the *common*
//! case, and a full re-render. [`ModuleSet::These`] of an empty set means "render
//! nothing" (plan §5), so **the shell guard has no counterpart here**: the skip
//! below saves a full IR read and nothing else. `tests/incremental.rs` asserts
//! both halves — that the skip happens, and that removing it would still render
//! nothing.
//!
//! # The prototype's hole, and why it cannot be reproduced
//!
//! `incremental.sh:354-360` unions the two render-set derivations with
//! `sort -u "$WORK/impact-set.txt" "$GLOBALSET"`. But `impact` writes **no
//! `--print-set` at all** when the changed set is empty and the mode is not
//! `all`, and `sort` on a missing file fails, and the `|| : > "$RENDERSET"`
//! that catches it **empties the render set** — so a run whose only stale pages
//! come from the global map renders none of them, silently (plan §7, debt 1 / 2 /
//! 3). The union here is over two `Vec<String>` values in memory: one from
//! `ImpactRun::summary`, one from `GlobalSummary::delta`. There is no file in
//! the path, so "the file is missing" is not a state the union can be in.
//!
//! `global-set.txt`, `impact-set.txt` and `render-set.txt` are still written into
//! `--work`, under the prototype's names, **as diagnostics** —
//! `tools/incremental-reference.sh` (M3-d3) records them and
//! `tools/incremental-compare.sh` compares them across the two implementations.
//! `impact-set.txt` is written by `impact` itself and is therefore still absent
//! exactly when the prototype's is absent — measured on both sides in the
//! `nochange` and `removed-one` scenarios 【実測 2026-08-15】 — and that absence
//! is now inert, because nothing reads it back. The prototype's `sort -u` over
//! the missing file still writes `sort: No such file or directory` to stderr in
//! exactly those two runs, which is the debt itself showing up as a diagnostic.
//!
//! # What a round is allowed to touch
//!
//! - **`prune` is called without an IR tree.** Pointed at a site, its orphan rule
//!   deletes every `.html` that is not a live module page, which on the target is
//!   the whole-package HTML artifacts — **438 → 435** at M6, and **439 → 435**
//!   since M8-d made four of them the site's entry pages 【実測, plan §7 debt
//!   4】. [`prune_removed`] is the only call site and its signature cannot name an
//!   IR tree, so the pipeline cannot ask for orphan sweeping by accident.
//! - **`name-map.json` is snapshotted before anything runs.** It is both the
//!   "before" side of the map delta and the file step 6 overwrites in place
//!   (`incremental.sh:199-202`). Snapshot it late and the delta compares the new
//!   map with itself: always empty, and every page that went stale through the
//!   global map is dropped without a word — debt 1's failure reached by a
//!   different road.
//!
//! # What this command is not
//!
//! - **It does not rewrite the ledger.** Neither does the prototype: `run.sh`
//!   re-seeds `base-ledger.json` for every variant it measures. A chain of
//!   incremental runs therefore needs its caller to rebuild the ledger between
//!   them (`litedoc4 ledger build`), or the second run re-extracts the first
//!   run's changed set again — wasteful, not wrong. **That caller is
//!   [`crate::build`]** (M4-d): this function hands it the ledger `detect`
//!   computed, in [`Run::detected`], and `build` writes it **after** the last
//!   step that can fail. The reason it is not written here is the same reason
//!   the prototype does not write it: a stage that answers a question must not
//!   move the state its answer was about, or a caller that stops on the answer
//!   has already lost.
//! - **It has no `--count-reads`.** The prototype's read counter wraps every
//!   `deno` step to answer "how many times does one run read the whole IR"; it
//!   makes the timings meaningless and is a measurement tool, not a product flag.
//! - **It has no `--l3-1 on|off`.** `off` was the ablation that measured L3-1's
//!   contribution, and it **produces a wrong site** — a referring module keeps an
//!   IR that names the module a declaration used to live in. A switch whose
//!   `off` position is "be incorrect" does not belong on a product's surface
//!   【判断】.
//! - **It has no `--global old|new`.** `old` was stage 5's two-process
//!   derivation, kept as the control of stage 7h's A/B. The product is always the
//!   cached one, which is why **`--state` is required** rather than optional.
//! - **It has no `--module`.** The prototype's is a label: `incremental.sh:386`
//!   passes it straight into the timings record and nothing reads it on the way
//!   (`analyze.ts:121` already falls back when it is absent). A harness that
//!   needs to tell four variants apart adds the label to the line it appends, as
//!   `run.sh:178-193` does 【判断】.
