//! `litedoc4 watch`'s file server: **the bytes that were built, and nothing
//! else**.
//!
//! Feature sweep A-2. It is a few hundred lines over [`std::net::TcpListener`]
//! and it stays that way on purpose — this tree's whole dependency list is
//! `serde`, `serde_json` and `sha2`, and a static file server is not a reason to
//! lengthen it (`Cargo.toml`, and A-1's `curl` decision one feature over).
//!
//! # No live-reload script is injected 【判断】
//!
//! The obvious feature is a snippet appended to every page that polls and
//! reloads the tab. It is not here, and the reason is the same one that keeps
//! `build` and `site` sharing one function: **what a developer is looking at has
//! to be what they will publish.** A server that rewrites the HTML on its way
//! out makes the previewed page and the shipped page two different files, and
//! the difference is invisible exactly when it matters — a selector that only
//! matches because of the injected node, a script error the injected script
//! swallowed. `watch` prints a line per rebuild instead; the reload is a
//! keystroke.
//!
//! What the server *does* owe the reader is that the keystroke works:
//! `Cache-Control: no-store` on every response, because doc-gen4 #389 is
//! literally "local build does not refresh after code change" and a 200 the
//! browser served out of its own cache is that bug with the fix already applied.
//!
//! # The port is refused, never moved 【判断】
//!
//! A taken port is an error with a name ([`bind`]), not a reason to try the next
//! one. An address that moves between runs is worse than one that is refused,
//! because the tab the reader already has open then points at nothing and
//! nothing says so. [`DEFAULT_PORT`] carries the rest of the reasoning.
//!
//! # Loopback only
//!
//! `127.0.0.1`, not `0.0.0.0`: this serves a half-finished documentation site
//! out of somebody's working tree, and binding every interface publishes it to
//! whatever network the machine is on without anybody having asked.
