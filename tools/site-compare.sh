# Compare two whole sites byte for byte and say what differs.
#
# **M7-c moved dependency links, and this compares against a doc-gen4-era
# reference.** Every link into a dependency is now that package's version-pinned
# GitHub blob URL whenever the run resolves a package root (`build` always does;
# `site` and `render` do when given `--root`), so a diff here is **expected** and
# is no longer a failure of the port. Gate A is suspended, not redefined.
#
# A "site" here is what full generation produces: the module pages **and** the
# whole-package artifacts in one tree. That was 6 artifacts and 438 files for
# the target package when this comparator was written; M8-d took it to 7 and
# splitting `instances.json` out of the search index took it to 8, so it is
# 440 now, 441 once a module has been added. **The reference side is doc-gen4's
# tree and does not move with it** — which is one more reason gate A is
# suspended rather than redefined. `render-compare.sh` looks at `*.html` only,
# so it cannot see `declaration-data.bmp`, `name-map.json` or `references.bib`;
# `global-compare.sh` looks at those six and nothing else. This compares every
# file of both kinds, which is the milestone gate's denominator.
#
# usage: tools/site-compare.sh REFERENCE_DIR CANDIDATE_DIR [--show N]
#
# **No exception list.** A comparator that carries known divergences swallows
# the second one silently (plan §5); the registered divergence is pinned in the
# Rust tests instead, where a *set* is asserted rather than skipped.
#
# The candidate comes from `litedoc4 site`; the M3-d1 gate is
#   URL=https://github.com/FujiHaruka/information-theory/blob/573793b243fb1343636088eb62d1789ab2b14cec
#   cargo build --release -p litedoc4
#   ./target/release/litedoc4 site \
#     --ir /private/tmp/lean-doc-relay/w7h/base-ir --out /tmp/rust-site \
#     --source-url $URL \
#     --link-index /private/tmp/lean-doc-relay/w7c/linkindex/link-index.lidx
#   tools/site-compare.sh /private/tmp/lean-doc-relay/m2/gate/ref-site /tmp/rust-site
# Pass $URL unquoted: a `"..."` that keeps its quotes reaches the renderer as
# part of the URL and every page then differs.
#
# The same comparator answers the other half of M3-d1 — that composing the two
# subcommands adds and drops nothing — by being pointed at a tree built with
# `render` and `global` run separately over the same IR.
