Those portions have been **changed** from the original: some were transcribed
verbatim, others were restructured to write an IR instead of HTML. The blocks
concerned are marked in place with the doc-gen4 source path they came from —
`isProjFn` / `isBlackListed`, the attribute stringifiers, `getInstanceTypes`,
`getInstPriority`, `getDefaultInstanceAttr`, `getFieldOrigin`, `mkTacticOut`,
the `Core.Context` options, `collectSpans`, the kind/modifier split, and
`structureMembers`. See `docs/provenance.md` for the full inventory.

This binary does **not** link doc-gen4 — it imports only `Lean`.

---

**litedoc4's extractor.** Milestone M4-a **moved** this file — it did not port
it: the extractor is the one stage that has to run inside the target package's
Lean environment (`importModules` over its oleans), so it stays Lean while
everything outside it is Rust (`docs/implementation-plan.md` §5.6).

The source it moved from is `experiments/stage7d/Extract.lean`, which is
**frozen** together with the rest of `experiments/`: every number in
`docs/verification-log.md` was taken with a binary built there, and an extractor
that has been edited cannot reproduce them. That copy is therefore left exactly
as it is, and this one is the product's.

**Two changes were made on the way in, both to the command line and neither to
what comes out** (`extractor/README.md` lists them, and the M4-a gate is a byte
comparison of the IR tree this binary writes against the frozen binary's over the
same module list — 436/436 files):

1. `defaultIrDir` is **gone**. It held one session's scratchpad path, so a
   `--write-ir` run that forgot `--ir-dir` wrote several MB into a directory the
   caller had never named. `--ir-dir` is now required whenever `--write-ir` is.
2. The `IR_DIR` environment variable is **no longer read**; see `getIrDir`.

Stage 7d, which this file is a copy of, added two things to stage 7c and changed
**nothing** about what comes out:

1. `--pp-breakdown` splits `ppUs` — the counter `approach.md` §6.1 puts 75% of
   the extraction into — along the steps the Lean pretty printer takes:
   delaborate, sanitize, parenthesize, format, lay out. Plus `--decl-profile`,
   which keeps the per-declaration numbers so the distribution can be read.
2. `--jobs N` analyzes declarations on N threads. The candidate list is taken in
   strides and the answers are written back by candidate index, so the output
   order does not depend on N; `--jobs 1` runs stage 7c's loop verbatim.

**The IR is the invariant.** Every claim in `benchmarks/results/stage7d-summary.txt`
is accompanied by `diff -r` against the stage-7c control's IR; a configuration
that is faster and different is worth nothing here.

Everything below this paragraph is stage 4b's original header, still accurate
except where the stage-7a / 7b / 7d notes above and in `irSchemaVersion` say
otherwise.

Stage 4b experiment for litedoc4 (see `docs/approach.md` §5.4 / §5.5 / §6.1 and
`docs/plans/three-axes.md` leg 4).

Started as a copy of `experiments/stage4/Extract.lean`, which was itself a copy of
`experiments/stage3/Extract.lean` (stages 1-4 are frozen for reproducibility of
their numbers). Everything stage 4 did is still here unchanged.

What stage 4b adds is **positional tagged code** in the IR (`--tagged-code`).
Stage 4 increment 1 measured that a *set* of `(module, name)` references is not
enough to rebuild doc-gen4's signature HTML: 44.0% of its 72,421 signature anchors
have no textual relation between the printed token and the constant (`ℕ`->`Nat`,
`≤`->`LE.le`, `{`/`}`->`Singleton.singleton`), reconstruction from plain text plus
the set tops out at 56% recall (51.7% measured), and signatures are 71.1% of the
rendered bytes. So the IR has to carry *where in the printed text* each tag sits.
See `collectSpans` for the format and `experiments/stage4b/README.md` for why it
is a flat pre-order list rather than a tree.

`--tagged-code` also adds the three small things increment 1 found missing:
the declaration range's **end** line/column (doc-gen4's `gh_link` is
`#L<start>-L<end>`), the `noncomputable` / `abbrev` / `unsafe` / `partial`
**modifiers** of the kind word, and the declaration's **index** within its module
(two modules on the fixed target have declarations whose `(line, col)` tie).

Both IR persistence and tagged code are OFF by default (`--write-ir` and
`--tagged-code` turn them on) so that the stage-3 and stage-4 baselines can still
be reproduced from this tree; see the README's "Baseline identity".

The extraction stage 2 already did, for every declaration reached through the
index route:

* the pretty printed signature (binders + result type), through the same
  delaborator path doc-gen4 uses (`Info.ofConstantVal` -> `Info.ofTypedName`):
  `delabCore` with `delabForallParamsWithSignature`, `sanitizeSyntax`,
  `parenthesize`, then `format` of each binder and of the type;
* the docstring (`findDocString?`);
* the declaration kind (def / theorem / instance / structure / ...);
* the declaration range (`findDeclarationRanges?`);
* optionally the equation lemmas (`getEqnsFor?`), which is what actually
  elaborates. OFF by default, `--equations` turns it on.

The blacklist is a transcription of doc-gen4's `DocInfo.isBlackListed`, because
comparing times only means something if both tools keep the same declarations.

Only `import Lean`: litedoc4 does not depend on doc-gen4.

It also collects what doc-gen4's `getAllModuleDocs` collects (module docstrings,
direct imports, tactic documentation) — but enumerating the tactic table *once*
for the whole environment and bucketing by defining module, instead of once per
module. That is `approach.md` §5.2's "1 モジュールを処理するために全体を舐める"
pattern; on the fixed target doc-gen4 pays 16.7 s for it.

From stage 3: `--refs` collects, per declaration, every constant doc-gen4's
`renderTagged` would tag as `.const` — see `collectConsts` for the exact
semantics — and `--dump-refs` writes the unique set with its defining module.
Both are off by default so that the stage-2 baseline can still be reproduced
byte for byte from this binary.

From stage 4: `--write-ir` persists the result as module-granular IR (see the
"IR persistence" section below for the on-disk shape). `--refs` feeds it: without
`--refs` the per-declaration `refs` arrays are empty, so measure the two together.

New in stage 4b: `--tagged-code`. It makes the code walk record positions as well
as names, and puts them (plus the end position, the modifiers and the index) into
the IR. With `--refs` on as well the names are *derived from* the positions, so
the two walks are one walk and `refOccurrences` is unchanged.

Usage: extract <modules.txt> <out.jsonl> [options]
  --equations         generate equation lemmas (default: off)
  --write-ir          persist the result as one JSON file per module + an index
                      + a dependency-side map slice (default: off)
  --tagged-code       record, per printed fragment, the pre-order list of tag
                      spans `renderTagged` would produce, and add the declaration
                      range end / kind modifiers / in-module index to the IR
                      (default: off; bumps the IR schema version to 4)
  --no-attrs          ablation: skip the attribute collection (stage 7b)
  --no-inst-index     ablation: skip the instance type index (stage 7b)
  --no-member-extra   ablation: skip the structure members' binders / docstring /
                      origin (stage 7b)
  --no-sorry          ablation: skip the `sorry` / `sorryAx` classification
                      (schema 5, B-1). Any ablation marks the IR unrenderable.
  --ir-dir <path>     where to write it. **Required with `--write-ir`** and it
                      has no default (see `getIrDir`).
                      **Never point this inside the measurement target.**
  --dump <path>       write one JSON object per declaration to <path>
  --dump-modules <p>  write one JSON object per module (docs / imports / tactics)
  --only <path>       restrict processing to the declaration names in <path>

  --open <ns>[,<ns>]  pretty print with these namespaces opened
                      (probe for scoped notation; doc-gen4 opens nothing)
  --tag               additionally run `Widget.tagCodeInfos`, the step doc-gen4
                      needs to turn a signature into linkable `RenderedCode`
  --refs              collect the constants doc-gen4 would link from the
                      signature, the equations and the structure parent types
  --dump-refs <path>  write the unique set of those constants, one JSON object
                      per constant, with its defining module (needs --refs)
  --link-index <p>    also write the dependency closure's `name -> module` map
                      (`.lidx`) from the imported environment: the file the
                      renderer resolves docstring autolinks through, which used
                      to be derived from a doc-gen4 site's
                      `declaration-data.bmp` (see `writeLinkIndex`)
  --link-index-omit <p>  modules whose declaration groups are left out of that
                      map, one name per line. Their names stay in the `@`
                      section (段 C; see `writeLinkIndex`)
  --link-index-key <t>  an opaque token standing for everything about the map
                      that this process cannot see — the caller's `extractKey`
                      and the omit list. With it, a map whose sidecar
                      `<p>.key` holds the same token and whose `@` section is
                      still this environment's is left alone: no scan, no
                      write (段 D; see `writeLinkIndex`)
  --skip-analyze      skip the semantic analysis (module docs / tactics only)
  --tactics-emulate   additionally run the tactic collection doc-gen4's way
                      (`allTacticDocs` once per module) for comparison
  --tactics-probe     additionally break `allTacticDocs` down into its parts

/-! ## The dependency closure's `name -> module` map (`--link-index`)

The renderer resolves a docstring autolink the way doc-gen4's
`Output/DocString.lean:nameToLink?` does: it looks the token up in a global
`name -> module` map. doc-gen4 holds the whole environment and reads
`env.name2ModIdx`; the renderer holds none of it, so for it the map is an input
file — the `.lidx` read by `crates/litedoc4-render/src/link_index.rs`. It is not
optional: with the same IR and the same `--source-url`, having it or not moves
432 of 432 pages' worth of links and 150 pages' bytes (実装計画 決定 4).

Until M5 that file was derived from a doc-gen4 site's
`declarations/declaration-data.bmp` (`experiments/stage7d/build-link-index.ts`),
which presumes a published site built from the *same* Lean and Mathlib as the
package being documented. For this target that is false — the published site is
two Lean minor versions ahead (実装計画 §4, 実測) — so the map is built here
instead, from the environment this process has already imported.

**What goes in is doc-gen4's choice, which is three predicates, not one:**

* `Process/Analyze.lean:195` walks `env.constants` and asks `DocInfo.ofConstant`,
  which drops the blacklisted (`isBlackListed`, transcribed above) and the
  recursors (`ConstantInfo.recInfo`);
* `Output/ToJson.lean:136` drops private names on the way into the JSON;
* the module of a name is `env.const2ModIdx` — that is literally what
  `Output/Base.lean:231`'s `declNameToLink` reads — and **not** the module whose
  `constNames` the name was reached through. The two disagree for the names that
  live in more than one module's olean (25 on this target, 段階 1).

Walking modules instead of `env.constants` costs one extra hash lookup per name
and buys a deterministic order (`header.moduleNames`, i.e. import order), so two
runs of this produce byte-identical files.

**Escaping is not uniform, and that is copied rather than fixed**: declaration
names are `Name.toString` with escaping on, because that is what doc-gen4 writes
into the `.bmp` (798 escaped names on this target), while module names are
written unescaped, because doc-gen4 builds the page path out of
`Name.toString (escape := false)` components (`Output/Base.lean:188`) and the
renderer splits the module on `.` to rebuild that path. No module name on this
target needs escaping, so the two spellings coincide here.

**M7-a — each declaration also carries its source line range**, so that a link
into a dependency can be a version-pinned GitHub blob URL with the anchor
doc-gen4's own pages already have
(`…/Mathlib/Order/Basic.lean#L67-L67`, 実装計画 §M7):

```text
#lidx2                                  the marker moves with the field count
Mathlib.Order.Basic                     a group header, unescaped
\tMathlib.Order.le_refl\t67\t67         name, first line, last line
\t<a name with no range>                a declaration with no range: one field
```

The range is `findDeclarationRanges?`'s `range.pos.line` and
`range.endPos.line` — the same two fields the IR's own `line`/`endLine` carry
(`baseInfo`), which is what doc-gen4 builds the anchor out of. A name a tab can
never appear in is what makes the extra fields unambiguous.

**A declaration with no range keeps the one-field line.** Dropping it would lose
the link entirely, where the missing range only costs the anchor: the fallback
is a blob URL without one, which is the shape doc-gen4's `gh_nav_link` already
has (実装計画 §M7「行範囲が取れない宣言でリンクを消さない」). Both counts are
reported so that "no range" stays a number rather than a silence — and on the
measurement target that number is **0 of 255,975**【実測 2026-08-16 →
`benchmarks/results/m7a-summary.txt`】, so the fallback has no instance here and
is covered by the reader's unit tests only.

### 段 C — the package's own groups can be left out (`--link-index-omit`)

**The renderer never reads them.** A docstring token is resolved by
`NameIndex::module_of` (`crates/litedoc4-render/src/autolink.rs:258`), which
asks the IR-derived index *first* and only falls back to the `.lidx`, so a name
the package itself declares is answered before this file is consulted at all.
And the line range this file carries is spent only where
`ExternalLinks::url_for` has a root for the module
(`crates/litedoc4-render/src/external.rs:146-162`) — that is, only for a
**dependency**: for an own-package module `href` takes the relative-page branch
and drops the range it was handed. So every own-package group in the map is
written, read past, and discarded.

That is an argument, and it was measured rather than believed: with all of the
package's own groups removed from the map, the rendered site is **byte-identical
— 0 of 429 files differ**; the positive control, which removes the *dependency*
half instead, differs in **408 of 429**【実測 2026-08-17 →
`benchmarks/results/lidx-own-half-2026-08-17.txt`】.

**Why leave them out, given that they are only 3.6% of the file.** Because they
are the only part of it that moves when a module of the package is edited, and
the map's SHA-256 is part of the renderer's `renderKey`: one added declaration
moves the map, the key moves with it, and all 422 pages re-render for an edit
that touched one. Dropping the own half makes the map stop moving for exactly
the edits this pipeline exists to make cheap.

**The `@` section stays complete — omitted modules included.** It is a different
map answering a different question: `module_for_source_path`
(`crates/litedoc4-render/src/autolink.rs:289-315`) scans `known_modules`
linearly for a docstring source path and answers `None` when **two** entries
match, so taking an entry out can turn a `None` into a `Some` — a link that did
not exist before, possibly to a page this run did not write. The measurement saw
no difference on this target either way; keeping the set whole is what stops
that from being a claim about this target only.

**What is left out is counted, not merely absent** (`omitted`,
`omittedDeclarations`). An omitted module is walked exactly as it would be
otherwise and only its *output* is dropped, which makes both counts exact and
leaves the run with two invariants a reader can check against a run without the
flag: `modules + omitted` and `declarations + omittedDeclarations` are that
run's `modules` and `declarations`, and `scanned` does not move at all. The
saving that is given up by still walking them is ~3.6% of a 0.9 s phase; a
silent omission is the failure mode this project keeps catching, and it is not
worth 30 ms.

### 段 D — a map that is already right is not rewritten (`--link-index-key`)

段 C made the map stop *moving*; it still gets *rewritten* on every extraction
request — 490,287 constants walked and 10 MB written, **1.20〜1.81 s** of a 6.2 s
one-module incremental build【実測 2026-08-17 →
`benchmarks/results/g3-stage-c-2026-08-17.txt`】. The file it produces is a
function of exactly three things:

1. **the set of modules in the imported environment** (`env.header.moduleNames`),
   which decides both the `@` section and which oleans are walked;
2. **the contents of those modules' oleans**, which decide the names and their
   line ranges;
3. **the omit list**, which decides whose groups are dropped.

Only (1) is something this process can read cheaply — it is already in memory.
(2) would mean hashing the dependency closure's oleans, which is most of the cost
this is trying to avoid, and (3) is the caller's own input. So (2) and (3) are
delegated: the caller passes **one opaque token** (`--link-index-key`) that it
promises moves whenever either of them does, and this process checks (1) itself.
On this pipeline the token is a digest of the run's `extractKey` (Lean toolchain
+ `lake-manifest.json` SHA-256 + extractor id + IR schema) and the omit list's
bytes — the same key that already invalidates every IR on the Rust side, so a
toolchain or dependency bump re-writes the map for the same reason it re-extracts
everything.

**The token goes in a sidecar `<path>.key`, not in a `#` header line of the map**
— and that is not a style choice. The map's SHA-256 is an input to the renderer's
`renderKey`, so anything written *into* the file re-renders every page when it
changes. Folding `extractKey` in would tie every toolchain bump to a full
re-render of a map whose content did not move, which is precisely the coupling
段 C exists to break. A separate file carries the token without touching the
bytes the renderer hashes.

**The `@`-section comparison is not redundant with the token, in either
direction.** The token cannot see the closure: a package that adds
`import Mathlib.NewThing` pulls in modules whose declarations belong in the map,
and neither `lean-toolchain` nor `lake-manifest.json` moves for it — the token
would still match while the map is short. Conversely the `@` section cannot see
the oleans: the same module list can be built from a different Mathlib. Each
closes what the other leaves open, so **both** are required, compared **in order
and in count** (a prefix match would accept a truncated map, and equal counts
with a reordered list would accept a map written under a different import order,
whose group order is that same list — see the ordering note above).

**The failure direction is: any doubt rewrites.** No token, no sidecar, an
unreadable sidecar, a token that differs, a count that differs, one name that
differs — every one of them falls through to the full walk and a full write.
Being wrong here means serving a stale map, which is silent; being conservative
costs 1.2 s. And when no token is supplied at all, a stale `<path>.key` left by
an earlier run is **deleted**, so a later run with a token cannot match a sidecar
that describes a map this run has since overwritten. -/

  `@` section was *read* and compared but not produced, so `moduleNames` is 0
  too. The map still on disk holds whatever the run that wrote it counted. A

  is why this flag is reported unconditionally in the events file rather than
  only when it is true. -/

/-- 段 D: where the token that describes a map is kept — beside it, never in it.

`<the map>.key`, so the two travel together and a `rm` of the map's directory
takes both. See `writeLinkIndex`'s 段 D heading for why this is not a `#` line
of the map itself (the map's SHA-256 is an input to the renderer's key). -/
def linkIndexKeyPath (path : FilePath) : FilePath := ⟨path.toString ++ ".key"⟩

/-- The marker `writeLinkIndex` puts on the first line, and the one 段 D's reuse
check requires to be there already.

**One definition for both** because it is the only thing standing between a
format change and a map reused across it. The caller's token covers the oleans
and the omit list; it does **not** cover this file's own layout, and the value in
`extractKey` that names the extractor (`EXTRACTOR_ID`) is a constant somebody has
to remember to bump. The marker is the guard that does not need remembering: the
number in it moves with the field count (see `writeLinkIndex`'s heading, where
`#lidx1` is name-only and `#lidx2` adds the two line numbers), so a writer that
changes the format changes this string in the same edit, and every map written
before it stops being reusable on the next run. -/
def linkIndexMarker : String := "#lidx2"

/-- 段 D: does the `@` section of an existing `.lidx` still describe this
environment?

Reads the file **a line at a time and stops at the first line that is neither
`#` nor `@`**, which is the group header of the first declaration group: the
`@` section is written first (`writeLinkIndex`), so this touches the head of a
10 MB file rather than the whole of it. `#` lines are skipped because the format
marker (`#lidx2`) is one and the renderer's own parser ignores them, so a future
comment line must not be read as the end of the section.

The comparison is **in order and in count**: `i` walks `modNames` in step with
the `@` lines, a mismatch fails immediately, and reaching the end of the section
with `i` short of `modNames.size` (a truncated map) or finding an `@` line past
the end (a longer one) fails too. Order matters because the map's group order is
this same array's order; count matters because a prefix would otherwise pass.

Module names are compared against `toString (escape := false)`, which is how
`writeLinkIndex` spells them — see the escaping note in its heading, where the
two spellings are deliberately different for declarations and modules. -/

    -- it named every module.
    return i == modNames.size

/-- 段 D: is the map already on disk the one this run would write?

**Three** halves have to hold, which is one more than the design started with:
the caller's token, which covers the oleans and the omit list; the `@` section,
which covers the module set (see `writeLinkIndex`'s 段 D heading for why neither
implies the other); and `linkIndexMarker`, which covers **this file's own
format** — the one input neither of the other two can see, because the caller
cannot know what shape this code writes and the module set is the same whatever
shape it is written in. Everything that is not a clear "yes" answers `false`: a
missing map, a missing or unreadable sidecar, a token that differs by one byte, a
section that differs by one name, a marker from an older format. Rewriting when
it was not needed costs 1.2 s; not rewriting when it was needed serves a stale
map, silently.

The marker is required on the **first** line rather than looked for among the
`#` lines: that is where `writeLinkIndex` puts it, and accepting it anywhere
would accept a file that has a `#lidx1` first line and a `#lidx2` comment.

The sidecar is written with a trailing newline and compared after trimming ASCII
whitespace: the token is a hex digest with no whitespace in it, so this is an
exact comparison that also tolerates a file somebody `echo`ed by hand. -/

/-! ## Attributes — doc-gen4's `getAllAttributes`, transcribed

**Copied verbatim from doc-gen4**, changed only where a `ToString` instance was
turned into a plain `def`:

`DocGen4/Process/Attributes.lean`. doc-gen4 calls it from `Info.ofTypedName`
(`Process/NameInfo.lean:125`) for **every** declaration and prints the result as
one `div.attributes` line (`Output/Module.lean:88-94`). Stage 7a did not collect
it, which is one of the three reasons `approach.md` §6.1 refused to quote 13.71 s
as a finished number.

Transcribed, not imported: `import Lean` is this extractor's only dependency.
The four lists and the composition order (`customs ++ tags ++ enums ++
parametric`) are doc-gen4's — the order is what the printed string looks like,
so it is part of the specification, not a detail.

doc-gen4 routes the value-carrying attributes through a `ValueAttr` type class
so that one loop can serve both `EnumAttributes` and `ParametricAttribute`. That
indirection is not reproduced here: the lists have 1 and 5 entries and are
`def`s, so the loop is written out. What has to stay identical is the strings
and their order.

## Schema 5: the name and the value are separate

doc-gen4 concatenates them — `parametricGetValue` returns
`<attribute name> <value>` as one string, and that is what schema 4 carried. The
pair is split here instead, and written on the wire as a two-element array
`["deprecated", "Foo (since := \"…\")"]`, the same shape `refs` uses. **The
split happens at this end because this is the only end that knows where the
boundary is**: an attribute value can contain spaces (`deprecated`) and brackets
(`specialize`), so a reader given the concatenation would have to guess, and a
guess made downstream is a second answer to a question already answered here.

Every collector below therefore returns `Array (String × String)`. A tag
attribute has no value and carries `""` — which is a different thing from a
value that happens to be empty in the printed form, but nothing in doc-gen4's
fixed list distinguishes those either, and the concatenation could not have.

/-- doc-gen4's `customAttrs` (`hasSimp`, `hasCsimp`, `getReducibility`) in order.
`semireducible` is the default and is deliberately not printed.

The reducibility name is taken from Lean's own `ReducibilityStatus.toAttrString`
rather than matched constructor by constructor, which is where doc-gen4 spells it
out (`DocGen4/Process/Attributes.lean`, `getReducibility`). The reason is a
version break, measured: **Lean v4.33.0 added `instanceReducible` to the
inductive**, and an exhaustive `match` over the four older constructors stops
compiling the moment a fifth appears — while one carrying `| _ => pure ()` would
compile and silently drop the new attribute from the IR instead
(→ `benchmarks/results/lean-version-2026-08-18.txt`). Deriving the string keeps a
single source building on v4.31 through v4.33 *and* keeps a constructor nobody
here has heard of in the output; the strings are unchanged for the four that
existed before, so the IR does not move — 436 of 436 files byte identical over
the measurement target, with 75 declarations actually taking this branch
(→ `benchmarks/results/lean-433-fix-2026-08-18.txt`). What is not derivable
is the bracketing, so that is asserted rather than assumed: if `toAttrString`
ever stops returning `[name]` this throws instead of writing a mangled attribute
— which, like every other `throwError` in the analysis loop, costs the
declaration and lands in the `failures` report rather than failing the process.
Verified by building a copy with the call replaced by an unbracketed literal: it
reported `failures (75)`, exactly the number of declarations in the measurement
target that carry a non-`semireducible` status, and nothing else moved.
The slicing is spelled `drop`/`dropEnd`/`toString` because that is what compiles
warning-free on all three toolchains: `String.drop` returns a `String.Slice` here,
`Slice.dropRight` is deprecated in favour of `dropEnd`, and `String.mk` is
deprecated in favour of `ofList` — all measured, not assumed. -/

  *after* `getAllAttributes`, so the order matters for the printed string;
* the **type index**: the class name and the head symbols of the instance's
  arguments. Those never reach a module page — the browser fills the
  "Instances" / "Instances For" lists from `declarations/declaration-data.bmp`
  (`approach.md` §5.5 L3-3), so this cannot move the byte reproduction rate by a
  single byte. It is here because doc-gen4 computes it and litedoc4 did not, and
  a comparison of two tools that are not doing the same work is not a

/-! ## Referenced constants — the demand side of the link map

doc-gen4 turns a `Format` into linkable `RenderedCode` in two steps:
`Widget.tagCodeInfos` (Lean core, `Lean/Widget/InteractiveCode.lean`) wraps every
tag position in a `SubexprInfo`, and doc-gen4's own `renderTagged`
(`DocGen4/RenderedCode.lean`) is what actually decides which of them become
`<a href>`. Only the second step names constants.

  /-- Every occurrence, not a set: the unique count and the occurrence count are

  /-- Time spent inside the collector itself (including `prettyTagged`). -/
  nanos : Nat := 0
  deriving Inhabited

/--
The names doc-gen4's `renderTagged` tags as `.const`, i.e. exactly the ones that
become links in its HTML.

`renderTagged` matches `.tag i t` where `i.info.val.info` is `Elab.Info.ofTermInfo ti`
and `ti.expr.consumeMData` is `.const c _`. Here the same test is done directly
against `infos`, skipping `Widget.tagCodeInfos`: the only thing that step adds is a
`WithRpcRef.mk` per tag (an `IO.Ref` allocation for the RPC layer), which cannot
change which names come out.

Two deliberate choices, both "reproduce doc-gen4" rather than "be complete",
because stage 3 asks whether litedoc4 reaches *the same* link targets:

* `Elab.Info.ofFieldInfo` and `.ofDelabTermInfo` carry constants too, but
  `renderTagged` only matches `.ofTermInfo`, so those are not links in doc-gen4's
  output and are not collected here either. This is likely a doc-gen4 oversight;
  it is reproduced on purpose.
* `Expr.sort` gets its own (non-constant) tag in `renderTagged`, and every other
  `Expr` head falls through to `.otherExpr`. Neither yields a name.

Walking *every* tag is equivalent to `renderTagged`'s recursion: it descends into
the subtree of a `.const` tag whenever that subtree is not a bare `.text`, and a
bare `.text` subtree carries no tags at all.

/-! ### Positional tags — the same walk, keeping the offsets (stage 4b)

`collectConsts` above throws the positions away. `collectSpans` below does not:
it is the same traversal, but every tag that survives into doc-gen4's HTML comes
out as a half-open interval over the fragment's **plain text**, in pre-order.

Offsets are in **UTF-16 code units**, not characters and not UTF-8 bytes. See the
README ("Offsets") for why; the short version is that the consumer is a
`String`-slicing runtime and this is the unit that makes `s.slice(start, stop)`
correct there without a conversion pass. Lean's own `String.length` is code
points, so nothing here may use it.
-/

@[inline] def charUtf16 (c : Char) : Nat := if c.val < 0x10000 then 1 else 2

/-- Length of `s` in UTF-16 code units. -/
def utf16Len (s : String) : Nat :=
  String.foldl (fun n c => n + charUtf16 c) 0 s

/--
One tag position over a printed fragment: `[start, stop)` in UTF-16 code units.

`kind` is exactly the three `RenderedCode.Tag`s that reach doc-gen4's HTML as an
element (`DocGen4/Output/Base.lean:334-389`):

| kind | tag | element |
|---|---|---|
| 0 | `.otherExpr` | `<span class="fn">` |
| 1 | `.const name` | `<a href="…#name">`, or `<span class="fn">` when the name is not linkable |
| 2 | `.sort _` | `<a href="…foundational_types.html">` |

`.keyword` and `.string` are deliberately absent: `renderedCodeToHtmlAux` renders
both as plain content, so they produce no element and no bytes.

  start : Nat
  stop : Nat

  /-- Schema 3. Width, in UTF-16 code units, of the whitespace `splitWhitespaces`
  cut off the **front** of this tag's bare text — the units `[start - front, start)`.
  doc-gen4 re-emits that run as plain spaces, so a consumer that does not know the
  width cannot tell a rebuilt `' '` from the pretty printer's original `'\n'`.
  Zero for every span that is not the `kind = 1` bare-text case. -/

/--
doc-gen4's `splitWhitespaces` (`DocGen4/RenderedCode.lean:150-157`) in offset
form: a `.const` tag whose body is bare text links only the trimmed token, the
surrounding whitespace stays outside the `<a>`.

Returns `(leading whitespace, total UTF-16 width, trailing whitespace)`. Both
whitespace counts are ASCII, so characters and UTF-16 units coincide there. The
all-whitespace case matches doc-gen4's: `trimAsciiStart` empties the string first,
so `back` is 0 and the (empty) anchor lands at the end.

    (0, 0, 0, true) s
  let (front, total, back, _) := r
  (front, total, if front == total then 0 else back)

/-- doc-gen4's sort split (`DocGen4/RenderedCode.lean:258-269`): when a `.sort`
tag's body is bare text, only the part before the first space (`Type` / `Prop` /
`Sort`) is inside the link; the universe that follows is not. -/

    (0, false) s).1

/--
The pre-order span list of one formatted fragment.

Node for node the same walk as `renderTagged` (`DocGen4/RenderedCode.lean:240-274`)
composed with `Widget.tagCodeInfos`:

* a tag position that is not in `infos` is **dropped** by `tagCodeInfos`
  (`Lean/Widget/InteractiveCode.lean`, the `none` branch returns the subtree
  untagged), so `renderTagged` never sees it and no span is emitted — the subtree
  is still walked;
* `.ofTermInfo` whose expression is `.const c _` -> kind 1, `.sort _` -> kind 2,
  anything else -> kind 0; any other `Elab.Info` -> kind 0. This reproduces
  doc-gen4, including its blind spot for `.ofFieldInfo` / `.ofDelabTermInfo`
  (see `collectConsts`);
* the two bare-text special cases (`wsTrim`, `sortPrefixLen`) narrow the span the
  way `renderTagged` narrows the tag.

**Pre-order, parent before child, outer before inner at equal offsets.** That
ordering is the whole nesting rule: a consumer replays the list on a stack and
closes a span when the next one starts beyond its `stop`. The parent's slot is
therefore reserved *before* its subtree is walked and patched afterwards.

/-! ## Pretty-print breakdown (stage 7d)

`ppUs` was one number: everything between the two clock reads in `timedPp`. Since
§6.1 puts 75% of the extraction there, the number has to be split before anything
can be said about reducing it. The split follows the steps the Lean pretty printer
actually goes through, which are the same ones doc-gen4 goes through:

    Expr --delab--> Syntax --sanitize--> Syntax --parenthesize--> Syntax
         --format--> Format --pretty--> String

`--tagged-code`'s span collection is *not* in here: it already has its own counter
(`refUs`), and it runs after `pretty` on the same `Format`.

The probe is `none` unless `--pp-breakdown`, and then every site is one `Option`
test plus two clock reads.

whatever the caller put in the `Core.Context` -- doc-gen4 leaves it empty, which is
why scoped notation never appears in its output.

  the elaborator that built it calls `addDeclarationRangesFromSyntax` with one
  syntax tree and `selectionRange` is **defaulted to `range`**
  (`Lean/Elab/DeclarationRange.lean:50-55`). The two being equal is therefore a

/-- Schema 5, B-3: the declaration `@[ext]` realized this one *from*, or nothing.

**This is the only origin litedoc4 emits**, and not because the others are
uninteresting: `simps` / `to_additive` / `mk_iff` / `to_dual` / `alias` keep
their maps in **Mathlib's** environment extensions, and an extractor that
imports Mathlib stops building against a Mathlib-free package — which is the
one thing `e2e/micro` and its CI gate exist to keep working
(`docs/plans/b0-generated-decls.md` §11). `extExtension` is in Lean core.

Two conditions, and **both are load-bearing**:

* **The name has one of the two shapes core builds, and the environment agrees.**
  `realizeExtTheorem` names its theorem `structName ++ "ext"` and refuses to run
  unless `isStructure structName`; `realizeExtIffTheorem` names its theorem
  `extName ++ "_iff"` (`Lean/Elab/Tactic/Ext.lean:107,142`). Neither name is
  guessed at — these are the two lines of core that construct them.
* **`selectionRange == range`.** Being in the extension is *not* the same as
  being generated: `@[ext] theorem MulHom.ext` is hand written and is in the
  extension. A hand-written declaration has a `declId` for the elaborator to
  record as its selection range, so the two ranges differ. A realized one is
  positioned by `addDeclarationRangesFromSyntax name (← getRef)` with no
  selection syntax at all, and `Lean/Elab/DeclarationRange.lean:53` then
  defaults `selectionRange` to `range`.

What comes back is the declaration the realization **took as input, one step**:
`P.ext` came from the structure `P`, `P.ext_iff` came from `P.ext`. The chain is
left for the reader to follow. Collapsing `P.ext_iff` onto `P` here would make
it claim a structure as its origin in the case where `P.ext` is hand written,
which is precisely the case the second condition exists to keep apart.

**`selectionRange == range` on its own is not "generated"** and must not be used
as if it were 【実測 2026-08-21 → `benchmarks/results/generated-decls-2026-08-21.txt`】:
over 2,786 Mathlib declarations it also fires on structure and class field
projections and on macro-defined declarations, and it does *not* fire on the
`to_additive` twins whose additive name the author wrote out. It is a necessary
condition here, joined to a name the environment can confirm. -/

/-- doc-gen4's `getFieldOrigin` (`Process/StructureInfo.lean:39-47`): whether the
field was declared in this structure, and which projection function names it.
For an inherited field the answer is the **parent's** projection function, which
is the name `fieldToHtml` links to.

/-- Fields and parents of a structure, as doc-gen4's `getFieldTypes` computes them.

Stage 7b keeps the binders `ppSignature` produces (stage 7a dropped them), and
adds the field's docstring and origin. Note what is *not* here: doc-gen4 also
runs `getAllAttributes` on the projection function a second time inside
`getFieldTypes`, and then throws that away on the way out of the database — the
output path reads the field's attributes from the projection function's own
`name_info` row (`DB/Read.lean:379`). The projection function is a declaration
this extractor already visits, so its attributes are already in the IR; doing the
work twice would only inflate this side's clock. -/

The words doc-gen4's `getKindDescription` (`DocGen4/Process/DocInfo.lean:211-247`)
puts in front of the kind word, as flags. Stage 4's IR only had `kind`, and on the
fixed target that mislabels 456 of 650 `definition`s and 1 of 56 `instance`s.

The composition rule is doc-gen4's, and the consumer has to reapply it (README,
"Kind modifiers"):

| `kind` | `span.decl_kind` |
|---|---|
| `definition` | `unsafe`? `noncomputable`? then `abbrev` if present else `def` |
| `instance` | `unsafe`? `noncomputable`? then `instance` |
| `axiom` | `unsafe`? then `axiom` |
| `opaque` | `partial def` if `partial`, else `unsafe opaque` if `unsafe`, else `opaque` |
| `inductive` | `unsafe`? then `inductive` |
| everything else | the kind word alone |

Where each flag comes from, in doc-gen4:

* `unsafe`, `noncomputable`, `abbrev`: `DefinitionInfo.ofDefinitionVal`
  (`Process/DefinitionInfo.lean:41-60`) — `v.safety`, `isNoncomputable`, `v.hints`;
* `partial`: `OpaqueInfo.ofOpaqueVal` (`Process/OpaqueInfo.lean:15-29`) — the
  existence of `Compiler.mkUnsafeRecName v.name`, which wins over `unsafe`;
* nothing for a theorem, even when it is an instance:
  `InstanceInfo.ofTheoremVal` (`Process/InstanceInfo.lean:66-85`) hard-codes
  `isUnsafe := false` and `isNonComputable := false`;
* nothing for `structure` / `class` / `class inductive`: those `getKindDescription`
  branches ignore `isUnsafe`, and `.quotInfo` becomes an `opaque` with
  `definitionSafety := .safe`.

/-! ## `sorry` / `sorryAx` — doc-gen4 issue #270

**Two claims, not one.** "This proof is a hole" and "something underneath this
proof is a hole" are read differently, so the IR carries `"direct"` or
`"transitive"` and omits the key when neither holds. It does **not** carry the
axiom set: every Mathlib-dependent declaration transitively uses
`Classical.choice` / `propext` / `Quot.sound`, so the full list is a large field
with almost no information in it (`docs/plans/feature-sweep.md` §4 B-1, 決定 2).

**`Lean.collectAxioms` is not the closure walk it reads like.** Lean keeps a
`PersistentEnvExtension` (`Lean/Util/CollectAxioms.lean`, `exportedAxiomsExt`)
whose per-declaration axiom arrays are computed when a module's olean is
*written*; for an **imported** constant `collectAxioms` is a binary search in
that module's entry array and walks no expression at all. Everything this
extractor analyzes is imported — `importModules` over the target's oleans — so
the memo that a per-declaration closure walk would need has already been paid,
once, by whoever built the oleans. Byte-identical in v4.31.0 / v4.32.2 /
v4.33.0, so this is not a version-specific accident to guard against.

**The direct half is the part that walks expressions, so it is only asked when
the answer can be `"direct"`.** A declaration whose axiom array has no `sorryAx`
cannot be either value and is answered by the binary search alone; the cost of
the whole feature therefore scales with the number of *tainted* declarations,
not with the package. That is what `--no-sorry` measures.
-/

/-- Does this declaration's **own** statement or proof mention `sorryAx`?

`Expr.foldConsts` rather than `ConstantInfo.getUsedConstantsAsSet`: the question
is a membership test rather than a set, and that function folds an inductive's
constructors into its answer — which would make a type whose *constructor* is
`sorry`'d claim the `sorry` as its own. -/
def mentionsSorryAx (ci : ConstantInfo) : Bool :=
  let has (e : Expr) : Bool := e.foldConsts false fun c acc => acc || c == ``sorryAx
  has ci.type ||
    match ci.value? (allowOpaque := true) with
    | some v => has v
    | none => false

/-- `"direct"`, `"transitive"`, or nothing.

A declaration that is both is `"direct"`: it is the stronger claim and the one a
reader acts on. The fallthrough for a name the environment cannot find is
`"transitive"` rather than `"direct"` for the same reason — `collectAxioms` has
already said `sorryAx` is down there, and claiming the hole is *here* without
having seen the term would be the stronger claim made on no evidence. -/

/-! ## Module docs and tactics — doc-gen4's `getAllModuleDocs`, restructured

doc-gen4 (`DocGen4/Process/Analyze.lean`) loops over the relevant modules and calls
`collectTactics module env` for each one; `collectTactics` calls
`Elab.Tactic.Doc.allTacticDocs`, which rebuilds the *whole* environment's tactic
table from the parser tables, and then throws away everything not defined in
`module`. That is 432 rebuilds of the same table.

Here the table is built once and bucketed by defining module. Everything else
(`getModuleDoc?`, the direct imports out of `moduleData`) is per module either way
and is a hash lookup.

/-! ## IR persistence (stage 4)

`approach.md` §5.4: the granularity is the module, so the layout is

```
<irDir>/index.json                     package index: module list, hash, path
<irDir>/modules/<Module.Name>.json     one file per module (the IR proper)
<irDir>/deps/<Root>.json               dependency-side map slice, one per package
```

Three properties are deliberate, all of them conclusions of stage 3:

* **Absolute identifiers only.** A reference is a `(defining module, name)` pair.
  No URL — relative or absolute — is stored; relativisation happens at output
  time (`approach.md` §5.6, verification log stage 3 increment 3).
* **The dependency slice is two columns** (name -> module) and covers only the
  constants this package actually refers to. Stage 3 increment 2 measured that
  slice at 53 KB against 34.3 MB for the whole of doc-gen4's `declaration-data.bmp`.
* **Every module carries a content hash**, which `approach.md` §5.5 wants as the
  single source of truth for "what has to be re-extracted / re-rendered".

The format is JSON because §5.4's point is that the *granularity* decides, not the
format; this is a throwaway experiment, not a format decision.
-/

/-- Schema version of the on-disk IR (`approach.md` §5.4). Part of every module
file, therefore part of every module hash: a schema change invalidates the cache.

Version 1 is stage 4's; version 2 is what stage 4b's `--tagged-code` wrote;
version 3 is stage 7a's, which added the `splitWhitespaces` widths to `kind = 1`
spans (see `spanToJson`); version 4 is stage 7b's, which adds the declaration's
attributes, the instance type index, and the structure members' binders /
docstring / origin. The flag picks the version rather than always bumping it, so
that with the flag off this binary still reproduces stage 4's IR byte for byte.

**Version 5 is the product tree's first bump** (`docs/plans/feature-sweep.md` §3:
束 B raises the schema once and later items add keys under the same version).
It adds `sorry`, whose *absent* key means "no sorry" — a meaning a schema-4 file
cannot carry, since there the key could not exist. The reading side keeps the
two apart with `ModuleFile::sorry_of`, which answers `Unknown` below schema 5;
`litedoc4-ir`'s `MIN_SCHEMA_VERSION` deliberately stays at 4 until the fixture
re-freeze (see its doc comment for why). Nothing has to migrate either way: the
extract key carries `irSchemaVersion`, so this bump re-extracts.

Version 5 also **changes** a field rather than adding one: `attrs` elements are
`[name, value]` arrays where schema 4 had one concatenated string (`B-2`). That
is a change the version number cannot announce on its own — the number was
already 5 when the elements were still strings — so `litedoc4-incr`'s
`EXTRACTOR_ID` carries it instead, and the reader accepts both shapes because a
schema-4 file is still readable and still says `4`.

`B-3` adds two more keys under the same 5, and bumps `EXTRACTOR_ID` again for
the same reason: `selectionRange`, written for **every** declaration of a tagged
file, and `generated`, written only for the declarations `@[ext]` realized (see
`extOriginOf`). The first costs **+0.96%** of the IR on the target
【実測 -> `benchmarks/results/generated-decls-2026-08-21.txt`】 and is paid on
every declaration on purpose — an omission rule would give its absence two
meanings. -/

/-- Where `--write-ir` writes. **`--ir-dir` and nothing else** — no default, and
the `IR_DIR` environment variable is not consulted 【判断, M4-a】.

The experiment had three sources, in the order flag, `IR_DIR`, `defaultIrDir`.
Both fallbacks are removed here, for the same reason and not for two:

* **`defaultIrDir` was one session's scratchpad path**, hard-coded. Every caller
  passed `--ir-dir`, so it never fired and never showed up in a number — which is
  exactly what makes it a footgun rather than a bug: a `--write-ir` run that
  forgets the flag writes several MB into a directory nobody named, and reports
  success. In a product tree that path also does not exist on anyone else's
  machine.
* **`IR_DIR` is the same hole with an extra way in.** It is the flag's value
  arriving from outside the command line, so an exported variable left over from
  another run silently redirects the IR of a run whose command line looks
  complete. The two callers that exist (`litedoc4 extract`, and through it
  `litedoc4 incremental --extractor`) always pass `--ir-dir`, so nothing is lost;
  `benchmarks/tools/read-ir.ts` and `html-inventory.py` read `IR_DIR` to find a
  tree, which is the reading side and is unaffected.

`parseArgs` rejects `--write-ir` without `--ir-dir`, so this is total in
practice; the `throw` is what makes "in practice" checkable rather than assumed. -/

/-- 16 hex digits of Lean's `String.hash`.

**This is a 64-bit non-cryptographic hash**, not SHA-256: Lean core (v4.31.0)
ships no digest, and pulling one in would put an unrelated implementation inside a
number this experiment is trying to measure. For 432 modules the collision
probability is ~5e-15, which is fine for change detection; it is *not* fine as a
tamper-evident content address, and leg 7 should revisit it if the IR ever becomes
a distributed artifact. `lean_string_hash` is also only stable within a Lean

/-- One declaration as it goes into the IR.

Two differences from `DeclOut.toJson` (the stage-2/3 debug dump, which stays
byte-compatible so the baseline check keeps working): the owning module is the
file's rather than a per-declaration field, and `refs` are deduplicated
`(module, name)` pairs instead of bare names in order of occurrence. Occurrence
order is dropped on purpose — it only means something together with the tagged
text it indexes, which schema 1 does not carry.

Schema 2 (`--tagged-code`) does carry it: every printed fragment gets a flat
pre-order list of `[start, stop, kind]` / `[start, stop, 1, name]` over its own
plain text (`collectSpans`). The plain text stays as it is — redundant with the
spans, but it lets a consumer check one against the other.

Schema 3 adds the two whitespace widths that schema 2 computed and threw away:
a `kind = 1` span whose tag text had leading or trailing whitespace is written
as `[start, stop, 1, name, front, back]`. Without them the consumer cannot
reproduce `splitWhitespaces`, which **rewrites that whitespace as spaces**
(`Base.lean:281-288`, `"".pushn ' ' n`) — same width, different characters. The
pair is emitted only when at least one of the two is non-zero, so the cost falls
on the fragments that need it rather than on every span. -/

/-- Stage 6: one process, many extractions.

The environment load is the extraction's fixed cost (~3.1 s warm, §6.5), and it
is paid per *process*. Anything that runs the extractor more than once per edit
pays it more than once — which stage 5e made the normal case rather than an
exotic one, because L3-1 turns re-extraction into rounds.

The import list is the **superset**: whatever `<modules.txt>` names, typically
the whole package. Requests then extract subsets of it. That is the right
direction for soundness — stage 5b's S3 refuted "a single-module target list
reproduces the full extraction" for `--open`, and the failure was that the
single-module list left the environment too *small*. A resident process's
environment is never smaller than the one-shot's, so it cannot fail that way;
whether it is nonetheless byte-identical is what stage 5h measures rather than
argues.

**What this deliberately does not do is reload.** An olean that changed on disk
after the import is not picked up: Lean has no way to swap one module out of an
imported environment. So a resident server is only valid for re-extracting
modules whose *own* olean has not changed — which is exactly the case L3-1
creates (the referring module is stale precisely because its olean did not move),
and exactly not the case for the module the user just edited. The protocol makes
that explicit by refusing nothing and reporting everything: the caller decides.

Protocol, one request per line on stdin, tab- or space-separated:

    <modules.txt> <out.jsonl> [<ir-dir>]

and one reply line per request on stdout: `ok <exit code> <nanoseconds>`.
