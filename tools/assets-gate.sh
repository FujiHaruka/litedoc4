# Is the site's TypeScript sound? — the half of `app.js` that `cargo` cannot see.
#
# `crates/litedoc4-render/build.rs` bundles `web/src` into cargo's `OUT_DIR` on
# every build, so a **syntax** error already fails `cargo build`. Everything
# else about that code is invisible to Rust: types, lint, format, and the tests
# over the index reader, the ranking and the theme. This is where those run.
# (The count is printed rather than written here — a number in a comment is a
# number that goes stale silently.)
#
# A gate rather than a test, by CLAUDE.md's boundary: it needs node, which
# `cargo test --workspace` must not.
#
# Four stages, and **each one has to be able to fail on its own** — a gate whose
# stages all fail the same way is one stage wearing four hats. The stage that
# failed is named on the way out, and the counts are printed rather than
# assumed: "vitest ran" and "vitest ran something" are different claims, and
# this project has been bitten by the difference (`cargo test --exact` matched
# nothing and exited 0).
