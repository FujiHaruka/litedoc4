//! Linking a dependency's declarations at **its own documentation site**,
//! for the names that site was verified to document.
//!
//! Feature **A-1**. Everything that touches
//! the network is here, and nothing downstream of this file knows there is a
//! network: [`litedoc4_render::DepDocs`] is a value — a base URL and two
//! name -> page maps — and [`litedoc4_render::ExternalLinks`] is where the
//! renderer reads it.
//!
//! # The rule is one rule
//!
//! A dependency's documentation is built from *a* revision (mathlib4_docs from
//! `master`; no versioned copy exists 【実測 2026-08-19,
//! `benchmarks/results/deps-link-rot-2026-08-19.txt` §9】) and the manifest pins
//! *another*, so the two can disagree about whether a name exists. The answer is
//! not to link optimistically and hope:
//!
//! * the site's declaration table holds the name ⇒ **the docs page**;
//! * it does not ⇒ **the version-pinned source**, which is what every
//!   dependency link was before this feature;
//! * the table could not be read at all ⇒ **the version-pinned source for
//!   everything of that root**, and the run says so on its own line.
//!
//! There is no "try the docs site and fall back on a 404": a build cannot see a
//! 404, and avoiding one is the entire reason the source link is pinned.
//! 【実測】 at a two month pin the fallback fires 0 times in 396 names; 【外挿】
//! at twelve months, 10.3 times.
//!
//! # Why `curl` and not an HTTP client
//!
//! This workspace depends on `serde_json`, `sha2` and its own crates. An HTTP
//! stack is a dependency tree with a TLS implementation under it, for one GET
//! per build of an optional feature — so the fetch shells out, exactly as
//! [`crate::build`] shells out to `git` and [`crate::extract`] to `lake`. A
//! missing `curl` is refused **by name**; a `curl` that ran and failed is the
//! "table could not be read" state above, because that is what it is.
//!
//! # What is kept in memory, and what is not
//!
//! The real table is **66,715,005 B of JSON with 420,714 declarations and
//! 11,351 modules** 【実測 2026-08-19】, and a build of the measurement target
//! already peaks near 4 GB. So it is streamed, and the two halves are bounded
//! differently because their smallest available bound differs:
//!
//! * **declarations are kept only if this run can refer to them** — the names
//!   in the IR's own `deps/*.json` slices, 527 of them on the target. The
//!   request set exists, so it is used.
//! * **modules are kept in full for the roots being linked** (11,351 entries at
//!   most, about a megabyte). There is no request set for them: the import list
//!   is not in `index.json`, so building one would mean reading every module
//!   file — a whole extra pass over the IR, which is a number this project
//!   reports and gates on (`work.irReads`).
//!
//! A name resolved only through the `.lidx` — a docstring that mentions a
//! dependency's declaration nothing in this package refers to — is **not** in
//! the request set and keeps its source link. The run's line names its own
//! denominator so that this is readable off the log rather than inferred.
//!
//! # When it is resolved
//!
//! **Once per run, from the IR tree whose render key the ledger is about to
//! record.** On a full generation that is the tree the extraction just wrote; on
//! an incremental run it is the tree the round starts from, because the render
//! key has to be known before `detect` compares it with the ledger's. Resolving
//! it twice in one run is how the pages and the ledger would come to disagree,
//! and a disagreement there re-renders every page on every run for ever.
