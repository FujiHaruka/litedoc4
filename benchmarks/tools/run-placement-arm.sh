# One arm of the placement A/B: build the documentation N times and leave behind
# what makes the numbers readable.
#
# The caller decides the arm by what it has already done to the machine — this
# script is identical on both sides:
#
#   arm `same`   is run in a job that has just finished `lake build`.
#   arm `split`  is run on a fresh runner that restored the same oleans as bytes.
#
# **Only run 1 is a placement measurement.** It is the one that pays whatever
# the page cache does not already hold. Runs 2..N are that runner's warm floor,
# and their real job is to normalise the arm against its own machine: the same
# `ubuntu-latest` label covers instances whose pure-CPU speed differs by 2.19x
# 【実測 2026-08-10】, so a raw same-vs-split ratio is
# confounded by which machines the two arms landed on. run1/runN inside one arm
# is not.
#
# Each run gets a fresh `--out`, so every run is a full build and none of them
# takes the incremental path.
#
# arm `cold` is the same runner as `same` with the page cache dropped before
# every build. It is not a placement — it is the **positive control**. If the
# A/B comes back "no difference", that reading is worth nothing unless the
# instrument is known to be able to show one; `cold` is the condition where a
# difference must appear, and if it does not, the measurement is broken rather
# than the claim being refuted. Dropping the cache is therefore allowed to fail
# the run: a `cold` arm that was not cold is a control that lies.
#
# environment:
#   ARM            same | split | cold                    (required)
#   PAIR           the matrix pair this arm belongs to    (default 1)
#   REPS           builds in this arm                     (default 2)

#   JOBS           extractor threads                      (default: nproc)
#   DROP           1 = drop the page cache before each build (default 0)
#   APPEND         1 = add to an existing inventory rather than start one
#   LITEDOC4_DIR   this repository                        (default ./litedoc4)
