//! One declaration's block on a module page.
//!
//! **What is emitted here is litedoc4's own markup as of M8-b**; up to M7 it was
//! a transcription of doc-gen4's, byte for byte, because the acceptance oracle
//! compared the two. The *decisions* are still doc-gen4's, and they are the part
//! worth keeping: which kinds get equations, which get an instances block, when
//! an inherited field may claim an anchor, and what counts as an equation too
//! long to print. Those came out of `Output/{Module,Arg,Definition,Structure,
//! Inductive,Class}.lean` by way of `experiments/stage7d/render.ts`, and every
//! one of them is a fact about Lean rather than about a stylesheet.
//!
//! The shape they are poured into is new, and its reference is the hand-written
//! `design/preview/module.html`. Keep the two in step: the stylesheet is written
//! against that file, so a class renamed here loses its styling silently rather
//! than failing.
//!
//! # Five things that are easy to get subtly wrong
//!
//! 1. **An inherited field is `isDirect === false`, not `!isDirect`.** The
//!    prototype's test is an identity comparison, so a *missing* key is a
//!    direct field. [`litedoc4_ir::Member::is_direct`] is therefore an
//!    `Option<bool>` and [`litedoc4_ir::Member::is_inherited`] is the only
//!    reader — plan §5. No byte comparison on this package can catch the other
//!    reading: all 156 field members carry the key 【実測】.
//! 2. **The equation limit counts code points**, not bytes and not UTF-16
//!    units (`RenderedCode.textLength` is over Lean `Char`s).
//! 3. **The `div.attributes` element ends in a newline.** It is the one
//!    non-flattened element at this level, so `Html.toStringAux` prints
//!    `<div …>…</div>\n`, and the newline belongs to the element rather than to
//!    the join around it.
//! 4. **[`decl_name_to_link`] fails rather than guessing.** doc-gen4 indexes
//!    `name2ModIdx` with `!` and panics; emitting a plausible `href` instead
//!    would be a wrong byte that costs a debugging round to locate.
//! 5. **Attribute order is byte identity.** [`DeclRenderer::structure_html`]'s
//!    two `<li>` shapes write `id` before `class` and `class` alone; the
//!    inherited branch's optional `id` is not the direct branch's `id`, and
//!    the two are written out separately for that reason.
