# untidiness — and refactors do not read NOTICE files (provenance.md §6).

# NOTICE against the dependency closure — **the half that must not be curated**.
# Which crates are in the closure changes without anyone editing this repository,
# so a reviewed list goes stale silently: `strum` / `phf` / `zmij` shipped in the
# binary with no notice for that reason 【実測, docs/provenance.md §7-8】.
#
# No exception list. A crate needs its own notice iff its licence expression is
# **not satisfiable by Apache-2.0 alone** — either it does not offer Apache-2.0,
# or it ANDs something onto it. `MIT OR Apache-2.0` is covered by LICENSE and
# NOTICE; `MIT` is not; `(MIT OR Apache-2.0) AND Unicode-3.0` is not.
#
# The targets come from release.yml rather than a copy: the closure is
# platform-dependent, and checking one target while shipping two is the same
# silent narrowing as checking one direction of a two-way diff.
#
# The `|| true` on the two pipelines below is load-bearing: `grep` exits 1 when
# it matches nothing, and under `set -e` a command substitution ending in one
# kills this script **with no message**. Emptiness is the answer here, not an error.
