//! The ledger file: what a module's inputs hash to, and the two global keys.
//!
//! Ported from `experiments/stage5/ledger.ts` (frozen). Milestone **M3-a** —
//! see `docs/implementation-plan.md` §6, whose data-format table pins the shape:
//! one `ledger.json`, `ledgerSchema: 2`, `extractKey` / `renderKey` inside it,
//! values in the clear.
//!
//! ```text
//! module name ──> <libDir>/<Module/Path>{.olean,.olean.server,.olean.private}
//!                   │
//!                   ├─ --algorithm sha256: read the bytes, hash them here
//!                   └─ --algorithm lake:   read <file>.hash, already on disk
//!                   │
//!                   └──> ModuleEntry.hash = sha256("<path> <hash>\n…")
//! ```
//!
//! # What is hashed, and why it is the olean
//!
//! The extractor's only view of a module is its `.olean`: `importModules` reads
//! nothing else. The `.lean` source is one step too early — it carries changes
//! the olean does not (whitespace inside a proof) and misses changes the olean
//! has (anything a rebuild of a dependency puts there) — and the IR's own
//! `contentHash` is one step too late, because computing it means running the
//! extraction this stage exists to skip. That hash has the other job: which
//! *pages* to rewrite.
//!
//! Modules built with Lean's module system have up to three olean files and
//! **all present ones are hashed**: declaration ranges and docstrings live in
//! the server data and private declarations in the private one. On the
//! measurement target the package's own modules have only `.olean`; Mathlib's
//! have all three.
//!
//! # The per-module hash is over the per-file hashes, not over the bytes
//!
//! [`ModuleEntry::hash`] is a SHA-256 of `"<relative path> <file hash>"` lines,
//! so a module that gains or loses one of its three files changes even when
//! every file it kept is identical.
