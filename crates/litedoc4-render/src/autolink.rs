//! Derived from doc-gen4 (Copyright (c) 2021 Henrik Böving, Apache-2.0) and
//! changed; see this repository's NOTICE and `docs/provenance.md`.
//!
//! Resolving the names a docstring mentions to pages. This is the half of
//! `DocGen4/Output/DocString.lean` that md4c does not replace.
//!
//! It lives here rather than in `litedoc4-md` — whose [`litedoc4_md::Renderer`]
//! takes the [`LinkResolver`] this implements — because the answer needs
//! [`LinkIndex`] and the IR, neither of which a markdown crate should know
//! about, and the crate dependency runs `litedoc4-render` → `litedoc4-md`.
//!
//! `nameToLink?`'s first branch is here for a related reason. A word that ends
//! in `.lean` and contains a `/` is a path to a source file, and doc-gen4 turns
//! it into a page with no index at all: the path is read as relative to the
//! repository root and the extension is swapped. That is right for
//! `Mathlib/Order/Basic.lean` and wrong for a package whose docstrings write
//! the path relative to their own module — the produced page is never written,
//! and 160 of the target site's 32,868 internal links were dangling because of
//! it 【実測 2026-08-16, `benchmarks/results/m8-ui2-dead-links.txt`】.
//! [`NameIndex::module_for_source_path`] consults `knownModules` instead.
//!
//! doc-gen4 asks `env.name2ModIdx` for which name is documented where, because
//! it holds the whole environment. This renderer holds none of it, so the map
//! is assembled from three sources: `known` (the IR's `deps/*.json`,
//! declarations and resolved references) is branch 2, the `.lidx`'s `\t`
//! entries are branch 2 after it, and its `@` entries are branch 3.
//! `known_modules` is the **union of all three**, because resolving with the
//! `.lidx` alone drops links one anchor at a time and the page still renders.
//!
//! "A name that is a module" and "a module this run wrote a page for" are
//! different questions — [`NameIndex::has_page`] is the second one. The gap is
//! **modules of the package being documented that this run does not render**: a
//! `lakefile.toml` may declare more than one `[[lean_lib]]` (`batteries`
//! declares three), so `--lib Batteries` extracts one of them while the `.lidx`
//! holds the whole environment, and `BatteriesRecycling.*` is a known module
//! with no page 【実測 2026-08-17】. So the page set is carried separately:
//! [`NameIndexBuilder::build`] freezes it **before** the union, and
//! [`NameIndex::link_to`]'s last branch consults it.
