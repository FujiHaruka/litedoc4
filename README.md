# litedoc4

**Fast HTML documentation for Lean 4 packages — built for the ones standing on Mathlib.**

litedoc4 documents **your** package only. Declarations from your dependencies — Mathlib,
Batteries, Lean core, whatever your `lake-manifest.json` pins — are never regenerated: every
reference to them links to that dependency's **version-pinned source on GitHub**. The output is a
self-contained static site.

Live example: <https://fujiharuka.github.io/information-theory/> — 422 modules, one command,
**24.5 s**. A second one, <https://fujiharuka.github.io/litedoc4/>, is seven modules rebuilt from
this repository's `main` on every push: the declaration shapes rather than the scale.

## Is this for you?

**Yes**, if doc-gen4 is too slow for your CI and your package lives on GitHub and is on Lean
4.31.0, 4.32.2, 4.33.0 or 4.33.1. Any Lean 4 package works — the payoff just scales with how
large your dependencies are next to your own code, and Mathlib is as large as that gets. You get
a module tree, search, instance lists, "Imported by", "Used by" (within your package), typeset
math, hyperlinked signatures, and a dark theme.

**No**, if:

- **you want to search dependency declarations** — search covers your package only
- **you are on a Lean newer than 4.33.1** — the four versions above are the ones CI runs end to
  end, and they are listed in [`tools/lean-toolchains.txt`](tools/lean-toolchains.txt). The
  extractor is compiled against your toolchain, so a version it cannot handle surfaces as a build
  failure, not as bad output
- **you are on Windows, Intel macOS, or Linux/arm64** — releases carry Linux/x86-64 and
  Apple Silicon; anything else builds from source, which needs Rust and a C compiler

A `lakefile.lean` package is fine — the live example is one. The CLI will not guess library names
out of Lean code, so pass `--lib` by hand; used as a Lake dependency (below) it is read for you.

Already hosting doc-gen4 output? Page paths (`Foo/Bar.html`) and declaration anchors
(`#Foo.bar`) keep doc-gen4's shape, so existing links into your own docs survive.

## Math in docstrings

`$…$` and `$$…$$` become MathML **while the site is built**. Nothing is loaded in the browser to
draw them — no MathJax, no KaTeX, no math web font — because every current browser lays MathML
out itself.

A formula the converter cannot read is written back as its own source, exactly as doc-gen4 leaves
every formula, and the build says how many:

```
render  math spans kept as LaTeX 3
work    extract 422 / render 422 / math-fallback 3 / …
```

The line is printed even when it is zero, because a page whose formulas silently stayed `$…$` is
still a valid page. On Mathlib's own docstrings **2,113 of 2,123 formulas convert** (measured
2026-08-22, [`benchmarks/results/mathml-2026-08-22.txt`](benchmarks/results/mathml-2026-08-22.txt));
the ten that do not use commands the converter does not implement — `\colim`, `\dotsc`, `\cr` —
or are LaTeX no parser accepts.

## Configuring the site

`litedoc4.toml` next to your `lakefile`, both keys optional:

```toml
title = "MyPkg"          # the top bar, and the second half of every page's <title>
index = "docs/index.md"  # Markdown to put at the top of the site's index page
```

Without it the title is the name your modules share (`Foo.*` → `Foo`), which is what a reader
types to import your package.

It is a file rather than a flag on purpose: `build`, `site`, `render` and `global` all write HTML,
and a flag left off one of them would make two of them disagree about what the site is called. A
file in the package is read by whichever of them is pointed at the package.

A malformed file, an unknown key, or an `index` naming a file that is not there **stops the
build**. Carrying on with the derived title would be a site that quietly ignored what you asked
for.

## Speed

Apple M1 / 16 GB, warm page cache, wall clock. One Mathlib-dependent package throughout, at two
of its revisions (432 and 422 modules); each row names the one it ran on:

| | doc-gen4 | litedoc4 |
|---|---:|---:|
| Extract every module, single-threaded (432 modules) | 1,076 s | **14.08 s** |
| Full site from nothing, `--jobs 4` (422) | — | **24.5 s** |
| Rebuild after one added declaration (422) | — | **4.35 s** |
| Rebuild with nothing changed (422) | — | **0.31 s** |

The rebuild row is the median of 6 runs spread over 3.96–6.22 s. What moves between them is Lean's
environment load, not the work, so that wall clock is not something to gate on. The full row moves
the same way and by more: a second full build in the same session, with the oleans already
resident, takes **8.8 s** against a first run's 26.3 s, doing byte for byte the same work (measured
2026-08-29, [`benchmarks/results/v0.2.0-numbers-2026-08-29.txt`](benchmarks/results/v0.2.0-numbers-2026-08-29.txt)).
The 24.5 s is the first-run figure, which is what a CI job pays.

**The dashes are the point**: doc-gen4 is not doing these jobs. It documents your entire import
closure — ~8,600 modules here against your 432 — and regenerates every page on every run. That
build has never been finished on this machine (aborted at 42%, memory-bound, after 13,611 s of
CPU time, which extrapolates to ~9 h of CPU for the closure), so there is no wall-clock number to
put next to 24.5 s.

On a 4-core GitHub runner `litedoc4 build` took **11.5–20.7 s** for 422 modules. A first run also
builds the tools (~16 s extractor, ~24 s cargo, cached afterwards); the rest of the job is your
usual `lake exe cache get` + `lake build`. Peak resident memory ≈4.0 GB (3.88–4.03 GB across 50
runs). Raw logs: [`benchmarks/`](benchmarks/).

## Documentation on GitHub Pages

Copy this into your package as `.github/workflows/docs.yml`, and enable Pages in your
repository settings (Settings → Pages → Source: GitHub Actions).

```yaml
name: docs
on: { push: { branches: [main] } }
jobs:
  docs:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    permissions: { contents: read, pages: write, id-token: write }
    environment: { name: github-pages }
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v7
      - uses: FujiHaruka/litedoc4@v1.0.0
        id: docs
        with:
          cache-get: true             # `lake exe cache get` — drop it if you have no Mathlib
      - uses: actions/upload-pages-artifact@v5
        with: { path: "${{ steps.docs.outputs.site }}" }
      - uses: actions/deploy-pages@v5
```

That is the whole thing: the action installs elan if it is missing, runs `lake build` and the
docs **in one job** (split across jobs the oleans fall out of the page cache and it runs 5–12×
slower), and keeps four caches for you — Mathlib's oleans, the Lean extractor, the Rust build,
and last run's state, which is what makes the second run incremental.

Inputs you may need: `root` if your package is not at the repository root, `lib` if you use
`lakefile.lean`, `lake-build: false` if you already built the package **earlier in the same
job** (from another job the page cache is cold), `full: true` to ignore previous state.
Outputs: `site`, `out`, `timings`, and `binary-source` — where the `litedoc4` binary came from
(`release`, `cached` or `cargo`), so a caller can assert on it.

To archive instead of publish, swap the last two steps for `actions/upload-artifact` and drop
the `permissions` / `environment` lines.

## Running it locally

You need `elan`/`lake` and a package that `lake build` passes. The `litedoc4` binary can be
downloaded; the Lean extractor is always built here, because it is compiled against **your**
toolchain.

### As a Lake dependency

Add it to your `lakefile.lean` (or the `[[require]]` equivalent in `lakefile.toml`):

```lean
require «litedoc4» from git "https://github.com/FujiHaruka/litedoc4" @ "v1.0.0"
```

```sh
lake run docs -- --out ../mypkg-docs
```

Lake builds the extractor against your toolchain and the script fills in `--root`,
`--extractor-bin` and `--lib` for you — including for a `lakefile.lean` package, where `--lib`
otherwise has to be written by hand.

`--out` is required and must be outside the package (`litedoc4 build` refuses one inside), and a
relative path resolves against the package directory, so `../mypkg-docs` is the shortest spelling
that works.

The `litedoc4` binary itself is fetched for you. The script looks, in order, at `$LITEDOC4_BIN`,
`${XDG_CACHE_HOME:-~/.cache}/litedoc4/v<version>/<target>/litedoc4`, the GitHub release matching
the version in the revision you required, `litedoc4` on `PATH`, and finally `cargo build`. When
none of them answers, it says what it looked for and where. A download announces its URL before
the first request and is used only if its SHA-256 matches the `checksums.txt` published beside it
— a mismatch, or no way to compute a SHA-256 at all, is a refusal rather than a warning, and
leaves the cache empty.

Releases carry `x86_64-unknown-linux-musl` and `aarch64-apple-darwin` only. On anything else —
Intel macOS, arm Linux — the script says there is no asset for your target and falls through to
`PATH` and `cargo build`; that is a normal path, not a failure. **That last fallback needs node**,
because building from source builds the site's JavaScript too; a release binary needs nothing but
itself.

```sh
LITEDOC4_NO_DOWNLOAD=1 lake run docs -- --out ../mypkg-docs   # never reach the network
```

`LITEDOC4_NO_DOWNLOAD` set to anything non-empty takes the same path, and still uses a binary
that is already in the cache — turning downloads off does not throw away one you already have.

There is deliberately no `lean-toolchain` in this package: one that named a *higher* version
would make your `lake update` rewrite **your** `lean-toolchain`, and a *lower* one would be
ignored without a warning (both measured, `benchmarks/results/lake-package-probe-2026-08-18.txt`).
Without the file, Lake builds the extractor with your toolchain and says nothing.

### From a checkout

```sh
git clone https://github.com/FujiHaruka/litedoc4 && cd litedoc4

# the extractor — always built here, against your package's toolchain (~16 s)
TARGET_REPO=/path/to/your-package extractor/build.sh     # -> extractor/build/extract

# the binary — download it (Linux/x86-64 shown; aarch64-apple-darwin is the
# other one), which unpacks to litedoc4-<version>-<target>/litedoc4 …
curl -sSfL https://github.com/FujiHaruka/litedoc4/releases/latest/download/litedoc4-x86_64-unknown-linux-musl.tar.gz \
  | tar xz
# … or build it, which needs Rust (via rustup), a C compiler and node.
# node builds the site's JavaScript from the TypeScript in
# crates/litedoc4-render/web; mise.toml pins the version.
cargo build --release                                    # -> target/release/litedoc4

# then, with whichever of the two you have:
./target/release/litedoc4 build --root /path/to/your-package --out /path/to/docs \
  --extractor-bin ./extractor/build/extract --jobs 4
```

The site is `<out>/site`; `--out` itself must live outside `--root`. Running the same command is
incremental, so keep `<out>` between runs; `--full` starts over. The extractor is built against
your package's toolchain — rebuild it (~15 s) when that changes.

### While you are working on the package

```sh
./target/release/litedoc4 watch --root /path/to/your-package --out /path/to/docs \
  --extractor-bin ./extractor/build/extract --jobs 4
```

`watch` serves the site on `http://127.0.0.1:8484/` (`--port`) and rebuilds it whenever your
package's `.olean` files change. **It does not run `lake build`** — run that in another window;
`watch` notices the oleans it writes. That keeps the division of labour every other command here
has: you build the package, litedoc4 reads it.

It asks the same question `build` asks — which modules the ledger says are stale — once a second
(`--interval`), and rebuilds only when the answer has stopped moving, so a `lake build` still
writing oleans is never read half-finished. Every rebuild prints how many modules were
re-extracted, how many pages were re-rendered and how long it took; a wait says what it is
waiting for.

The pages it serves are the bytes it wrote, with no live-reload script injected — what you look
at is what you will publish — so reload the tab yourself. A port that is already in use is
refused by name rather than moved to the next free one.

One edited module reaches its page in **5.5–6.2 s** (median 5.65 s over 15 cycles; the first
cycle of a session costs 13.7 s). **86–89 % of that is Lean loading its environment**, which a
rebuild has to redo because Lean cannot swap a module out of an imported one — so that figure is
a floor, not something tuning the loop moves. It does not include your own `lake build`, which
runs before any of it. Apple M1, 422 modules, warm page cache; raw logs in
[`benchmarks/`](benchmarks/).

Run `litedoc4 --help-all` for the full flag list. The two you may need:
`--lib <Name>` if your libraries are not in `lakefile.toml`, `--source-url <url>` if `origin` is
not GitHub (another host is refused rather than guessed).

## Status

`v1.0.0` — the action and the released binaries. Tested on macOS (Apple Silicon) and
`ubuntu-latest` with Lean/Mathlib v4.31.0, and the browser side also on `windows-latest`.
Pin the action and the `require` to a tag — `v1.0.0` or later, since the names below are what
1.x keeps and the releases before it kept nothing. `@main` moves.

**Every Lean version above is run end to end on every change to the extractor or the fixture**,
and their output is compared: v4.31.0, v4.32.2, v4.33.0 and v4.33.1 produce byte-identical IR
once one rename is applied — Lean's own reclassification of a reducible instance
(`implicit_reducible` → `instance_reducible`, from v4.33.0). That rename is the only recorded
difference between them, in
[`tools/lean-toolchains.txt`](tools/lean-toolchains.txt) (measured 2026-08-29). A toolchain that
is not in that file fails by name. Only v4.31.0 has been run over a Mathlib-sized package.

### What 1.x keeps

The names your own files can contain do not move inside 1.x: the action's inputs and outputs,
`litedoc4.toml`'s keys, `build`'s and `watch`'s flags, and the site's page paths and declaration
anchors. The list is [`tools/public-surface.txt`](tools/public-surface.txt), and CI fails when one
of them goes missing.

The IR schema, the ledger and `.lidx` are internal, and you never pin them yourself: the action
and the Lake script resolve the binary by the version in the ref you pinned, so the extractor and
the binary always come from the same tree.

The extractor is not distributed as a binary. It **could** be — it is decided by the toolchain
alone, it is portable, and against the wrong toolchain it fails loudly rather than writing a
wrong IR (all three measured, `benchmarks/results/extractor-uniqueness-2026-08-18.txt`). It is
not shipped because at 226 MB it is not worth replacing a 16 s build that CI caches anyway.
