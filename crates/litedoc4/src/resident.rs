//! The resident extractor: **one Lean environment, many extractions**.
//!
//! Milestone **M4-c**. Ported from `experiments/stage7g/serve-ctl.sh` (185
//! lines, frozen) and the `--serve auto` half of `stage7h/incremental.sh`
//! (`incremental.sh:53-80, 175-195`).
//!
//! The environment load is the extraction's fixed cost and it is paid **per
//! process** (`Extract.lean:2700-2705`). L3-1 turns re-extraction into rounds, so
//! anything that runs the extractor once per round pays it once per round. The
//! server is the answer: import once, then answer requests over a pipe.
//!
//! ```text
//! lake env <extract> <modules.txt> <events.jsonl> --equations --refs
//!          --write-ir --tagged-code --jobs N --ir-dir <unused> --serve
//!
//!   stdin   <modules.txt> <events.jsonl> <ir-dir>      one request per line
//!   stdout  ready <ns> <envModules> <targets>          once, at start-up
//!           ok <exit code> <ns>                        one per request
//! ```
//!
//! # A pipe, not a FIFO and a holder process 【判断】
//!
//! The server's loop ends on EOF (`Extract.lean:2747`). In shell that is a
//! problem: a request that opens the FIFO, writes and closes it looks like EOF
//! and the server exits after the *first* one, so `serve-ctl.sh` has to park a
//! long-lived `sleep` on the FIFO as a holder and count `^ok ` lines by prefix
//! because separate invocations share no file descriptor (`serve-ctl.sh:17-30`).
//!
//! Here the driver is one process, so the request channel is simply the child's
//! **stdin pipe**, held open in [`Server::stdin`] for as long as the server is
//! wanted. That deletes the holder, the two pid files, the `mkfifo`, the polling
//! loop and the prefix counting — and it buys the property those pieces exist to
//! fake:
//!
//! > **A pipe cannot outlive its writer.** However this process dies — an error
//! > path, a panic, `SIGINT`, `SIGKILL` — the kernel closes the write end, the
//! > server reads EOF and returns 0 through its own exit path. The 3 GB process
//! > cannot be orphaned by a failure of the driver, because the thing that keeps
//! > it alive *is* the driver.
//!
//! The FIFO's holder is a separate `sleep` process and has no such property: kill
//! the driver and the holder keeps the server alive with nobody to stop it, which
//! is why the prototype needs `trap cleanup EXIT INT TERM` (`incremental.sh:186`)
//! and why that trap cannot cover `SIGKILL`.
//!
//! [`Drop`] is still implemented, and it is what makes the *ordinary* stop clean
//! rather than merely eventual: it closes the pipe, waits [`STOP_GRACE`] for the
//! server to leave through its own exit path, and only then signals. `main`
//! returns an [`std::process::ExitCode`] and this crate calls
//! `std::process::exit` nowhere, so every error path unwinds through here.
//!
//! # There is no `--serve-dir`: a server this process does not own 【判断】
//!
//! **Correctness comes from the server's olean generation, never from the round
//! number** 【実測, stage 6a】. A server imported *before* an edit answers with
//! the pre-edit owner of every name that moved — the exact stale pair L3-1 exists
//! to repair — and the site it produces is wrong; with such a server *no* round
//! is safe, including the round 2 that stage 5h had assumed was. So a server is
//! only usable by a caller who can show that its environment is the environment
//! the rest of the run is reasoning about.
//!
//! The prototype's `--serve-dir` hands that obligation to the caller and can only
//! read the server's self-reported `info.txt` (`incremental.sh:74-80`). The
//! product does not offer it. Residency is owned by the run: the pipeline starts
//! the server, and it starts it *inside* a run that begins after `lake build`, so
//! the shape stage 6a measured as wrong is not expressible.
//!
//! # The generation, which is checked and not assumed
//!
//! "Cannot be expressed" is still an argument, and this project's rule is that an
//! argument gets a measurement. [`Generation`] is the world the run is reasoning
//! about, taken as **Lake's own content hash of every olean of every module in
//! `--modules`** — the same files, in the same order, that the ledger hashes, so
//! the guard and `detect` cannot disagree about what "the world" is. It is taken
//! once at the head of the run and compared:
//!
//! * before every request — which, for the first one, is also the check before
//!   the server is spawned,
//! * again as soon as the server reports `ready`, closing the window in which the
//!   import itself runs,
//! * and after every request, so that the interval a request ran in is an
//!   interval the world provably did not move in.
//!
//! A difference stops the run with **exit 3** and names the modules that moved.
//! What that catches is the one way the pipeline can still be handed a stale
//! environment: a `lake build` that lands *while* a run is in flight. It costs
//! three `stat`s and one 64-byte read per module — 432 modules, so far below the
//! import it is guarding that measuring it would be measuring the filesystem.
//!
//! # `--jobs` is start-up configuration, not a request parameter
//!
//! `Extract.lean:2751` builds each request's `cfg` from the start-up one, so the
//! job count the server was started with applies to every request and there is no
//! per-request spelling (plan §6, constraint 6). That is why `--jobs` is a flag of
//! `incremental` only together with `--serve`: with `--extractor` it is the
//! extraction program's business and reaches it through `--extractor-arg`.
//!
//! # Two traps, both measured
//!
//! 1. **`--ir-dir` is required at start-up even though every request overrides
//!    it** 【実測 2026-08-15】. `serve-ctl.sh:120-121` starts the server without
//!    one, which worked against stage 7d's binary because it had a default. M4-a
//!    removed that default and refuses `--write-ir` without `--ir-dir` in
//!    `parseArgs` (`Extract.lean:2778-2782`), so the prototype's exact start-up
//!    command line now exits 1 before importing anything. The value passed here
//!    is a directory under `--work` that **no request ever names**, because a
//!    request that carries a third field replaces it (`Extract.lean:2753`).
//! 2. **stderr is inherited, exactly as the one-shot path inherits it**
//!    (`extract.rs`). It is not captured to a `serve.err` as the prototype
//!    captures it: a Lean error has to reach the caller, and the two extraction
//!    paths have to be diagnosable the same way. It is measurable, too — `lake`
//!    warns about the instrumented `doc-gen4` checkout on every start, and that
//!    warning is what puts `yes` in 5 of the 7 scenarios' `<s>-complained.txt`
//!    in the M3-d3 recording 【実測】. Capturing it would have changed an answer
//!    the gate compares.
