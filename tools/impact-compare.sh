# Compare two trees written by tools/impact-reference.sh and say what differs.
#
# usage: tools/impact-compare.sh REFERENCE_DIR CANDIDATE_DIR
#
# It takes both trees as arguments and cares about neither's provenance, so it
# still works — but **the loop it was built for is gone**. The reference side used
# to be `tools/impact-reference.sh --impl ts`, the frozen prototype, and
# `experiments/` was removed on 2026-08-16; it exists only at tag
# `experiments-frozen`. What remains is a diff of two recordings of the Rust side:
#   cargo build --release -p litedoc4
#   tools/impact-reference.sh --out /private/tmp/lean-doc-relay/m3c/before
#   ...change something...
#   tools/impact-reference.sh --out /private/tmp/lean-doc-relay/m3c/after
#   tools/impact-compare.sh /private/tmp/lean-doc-relay/m3c/before \
#                           /private/tmp/lean-doc-relay/m3c/after
# `cargo test -p litedoc4-incr --test impact` makes the same comparison in
# process -- but not from HEAD. Its one corpus test reads the reference pages,
# and `tools/corpus-tests.txt` lists that tree under `frozen`: emptied, with no
# regenerator outside tag `experiments-frozen`. The gate does not attempt it.
#
# Four classes of file, compared four ways — **by suffix, never by name**:
#
#   *-stderr.txt        NOT compared, and the reason is not laziness: a
#                       diagnostic's wording belongs to the implementation that
#                       wrote it. What *is* compared is
#                       *-complained.txt, which the harness derives from it —
#                       whether the run complained at all is a fact about the
#                       answer, and it is checked for every scenario.
#   *-prune.json        keys and values, ignoring every `*Seconds` (wall clock,
#                       different every run by construction) and with the run's
#                       own output root masked out of the strings — `pages` is
#                       the directory the run was given.
#   *-stdout.txt        byte for byte after masking the durations and the output
#                       root: both stages print the prototype's exact lines (that
#                       is what the port reproduced), so the shape is compared
#                       even though the clock is not.
#   everything else     byte for byte. The selected sets, the census, the
#                       summaries, the exit statuses, the surviving page trees
#                       and their counts.
#
# **There is no exception list.** Where a difference is still a difference, it is
# *classified* by a rule that names no file: a JSON file holding the same mapping
# in another key order is REORDERED, as in tools/merge-compare.sh. Nothing in
# M3-c is expected to reorder anything, so a non-zero REORDERED count is news.
#
# Measured 2026-08-12: **3,631 files compared, 3,631 identical**, 0 reordered,
# 0 differing, 0 missing, 29 not compared (*-stderr.txt).
#
# **What the denominator is made of**, because 3,631 flatters the stages: 3,458
# of them are the *surviving pages* of the eight page trees `prune` ran over —
# files neither implementation wrote, and the check is that neither deleted them.
# That leaves **165 computed records** (29 exit statuses, 29 "did it complain",
# 29 stdouts, 16 "was --print-set written", 12 selected sets, 12 impact
# summaries, 9 prune summaries, 2 censuses, and 27 listings and counts of what
# survived) and 8 input fixtures. Quote the 165 when the question is "does the
# port compute the same answers"; quote the 3,458 when it is "did it delete
# exactly the right files".
