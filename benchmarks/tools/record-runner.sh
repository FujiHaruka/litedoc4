#!/usr/bin/env bash
# Record which machine a measurement ran on, in enough detail to tell two
# `ubuntu-latest` runners apart.
#
# WHY THIS EXISTS
#   The four CI measurement workflows before this one recorded date, `uname`,
#   `nproc`, page size, image version, `/proc/meminfo` and `df` — and **all four
#   env files came out byte-identical** in every one of those fields (kernel
#   6.17.0-1020-azure, nproc 2, page size 4096, image ubuntu24 20260720.247.2).
#   Yet the runs behind them split into two clearly different machines: the same
#   cold import took 20.4 s on one and 63-89 s on the other, at 5.3 ms per major
#   fault against 0.67 ms 【実測 →
#   benchmarks/results/ci-importmodules-linux-summary.txt,
#   benchmarks/results/ci-prefetch-linux-summary.txt】. Nothing recorded
#   identified which machine a run had landed on; the split could only be
#   inferred from the numbers it was supposed to explain.
#
#   Worse for an A/B: a pure-CPU phase of the same work varied **2.19x** across
#   runner instances and did **not** line up with the I/O split — the runner with
#   the fastest disk had the slowest CPU 【実測, same runs】. Two arms on two
#   runners can therefore differ by 2x for reasons that have nothing to do with
#   what is being tested.
#
#   So this records the fields that name the hardware (CPU model, `lscpu`,
#   readahead, block devices) and, because none of them is guaranteed to be
#   truthful on a VM, a **CPU calibrator**: a fixed amount of pure-CPU work,
#   timed. A calibrator that differs between two runners is the warning that
#   their other numbers are not directly comparable.
#
# usage:
#   record-runner.sh <outfile> [<lean package dir>]
