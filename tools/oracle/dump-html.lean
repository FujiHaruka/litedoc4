dump-html.lean -- print *doc-gen4's own* HTML for a corpus of docstrings.

WHY THIS FILE EXISTS
--------------------
`crates/litedoc4-md/src/html.rs` claims to be `DocGen4/Output/DocString.lean`
transcribed. An expected value written by reading that file would prove nothing:
the reading and the port would share whatever mistake was made. So the expected
HTML comes from doc-gen4 itself — this script calls `docStringToHtml`, the same
entry point the real generator calls, and prints the bytes it produces.

WHY NO ENVIRONMENT IS NEEDED
----------------------------
`docStringToHtml` runs in `HtmlM`, whose context carries an `AnalyzerResult`.
That is only ever consulted through `nameToLink?`, and with the *default*
(empty) result every lookup misses: no `name2ModIdx`, no `moduleNames`, and
`currentName := none` so the "similar name in this module" branch returns
immediately. That is exactly the behaviour of `NoLinks` on the Rust side, so
the two can be compared byte for byte over the whole corpus rather than over a
subset with the auto-links filtered out.

The rest of the context is inert for this path: `sourceLinker` is never called,
`refsMap` is empty (the target package has no `.bib`, so `findAllReferences`
finds nothing and `findBibitem?` never matches), and `hierarchy` is only read by
the page templates.

WHAT IS COMPARED
----------------
`Html.toStringAux`, concatenated over the returned array — *not* `Html.toString`,
which additionally trims the end. Trimming happens once per page, around the
whole document; a docstring is one node inside it, and trimming here would hide
trailing whitespace that the real output keeps.

SOME INPUTS CRASH IT
--------------------
The same two that kill `MD4Lean.parse` (see `gen-md4lean-expected.ts`): a NUL
inside a fenced code block, and a GFM table with a header and no body rows. The
caller resumes past them by counting the answers that reached disk.

Input:  one JSON `[depthToRoot, markdown]` pair per line. `depthToRoot` decides
        `getRoot`, which is prepended to every relative link, so it is part of
        the bytes and the caller varies it.
Output: one JSON string per line, in the same order.

usage (from the measurement target, which is where doc-gen4 is built):
  cd /Users/haruka/dev/lean-projects
  lake env lean \
    --load-dynlib=.lake/packages/MD4Lean/.lake/build/lib/libleanmd4c.dylib \
    --load-dynlib=.lake/packages/MD4Lean/.lake/build/lib/libMD4Lean_MD4Lean.dylib \
    --run dump-html.lean <corpus.jsonl> <out.jsonl>

Nothing is written inside the target package: both paths are given by the caller.
