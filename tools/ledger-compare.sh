# Compare two trees written by tools/ledger-reference.sh and say what differs.
#
# usage: tools/ledger-compare.sh REFERENCE_DIR CANDIDATE_DIR
#
# It takes both trees as arguments and cares about neither's provenance, so it
# still works — but **the loop it was built for is gone**. The reference side used
# to be `tools/ledger-reference.sh --impl ts`, the frozen prototype, and
# `experiments/` was removed on 2026-08-16; it exists only at tag
# `experiments-frozen`. What remains is a diff of two recordings of the Rust side:
#   cargo build --release -p litedoc4
#   tools/ledger-reference.sh --out /private/tmp/lean-doc-relay/m3/before
#   ...change something...
#   tools/ledger-reference.sh --out /private/tmp/lean-doc-relay/m3/after
#   tools/ledger-compare.sh /private/tmp/lean-doc-relay/m3/before \
#                           /private/tmp/lean-doc-relay/m3/after
# `cargo test -p litedoc4-incr --test ledger` does **not** make this comparison.
# The byte comparison against the prototype was deleted rather than re-frozen
# (the head of `crates/litedoc4-incr/tests/ledger.rs` says why). What survives in
# process is `the_harness_scenarios_are_measured_on_a_synthetic_package`, which
# replays the twelve scenarios below on a `FakeRepo` -- so it needs no target
# repository, has no `#[ignore]`, and runs on CI.
#
# Three classes of file, compared three ways:
#
#   ledger-*.json   byte for byte, after substituting the **two** key strings
#                   the port deliberately changed (plan §6). The substitution is
#                   anchored on the key name, because `extractKey.irGenerator`
#                   holds the same string as the prototype's
#                   `extractKey.extractor` and must **not** move: it names
#                   whatever wrote the IR on disk, which really is stage4b.
#                   **It is a no-op between two Rust recordings** and is kept only
#                   so that a tree recorded before `experiments/` was removed is
#                   still readable; the two literals below are values a prototype
#                   ledger holds, not paths this script opens.
#   *timings*.json  keys and counts, ignoring every `*Seconds`: durations are
#                   wall clock and differ between runs by construction.
#   *.txt           byte for byte. These are the answers the pipeline consumes.
#
# `*-stdout.txt` is skipped: the two command line tools word their log lines
# differently on purpose, and every number in them is also in the timings
# record, which is compared.
