//! The `litedoc4` command line tool.
//!
//! **The subcommand surface is milestone M4's.** What is here is the
//! subcommands M1, M2 and M3 need to be judged: `render`, which turns an IR tree
//! into a tree of module pages, `global`, which turns the same tree into the
//! six whole-package artifacts, and `ledger`, which answers "which modules must
//! be re-extracted" without starting Lean. `tools/render-compare.sh`,
//! `tools/global-compare.sh` and `tools/ledger-compare.sh` run them against the
//! frozen prototype's output. Everything else — extraction, the rest of the
//! incremental pipeline, the resident server — arrives with its own milestone,
//! and guessing at its flags now would only have to be undone.
//!
//! **The product's command is [`build`]** (M4-d): a package in, a site out, in
//! one command — it reads the lakefile for the libraries, globs the sources for
//! the modules, derives `--source-url` from git, chooses between full generation
//! and the incremental pipeline, and writes the ledger back. Everything else
//! here is a **stage of it**, kept on the surface because each is separately
//! comparable against the frozen prototype and because the gates are stated
//! against them: `site` is full generation over an IR tree that already exists
//! (M3-d1), `incremental` is the six-stage round (M3-d2), `modules` is the glob
//! (M3-d2), `extract` is one extractor process (M4-b). A caller that wants to
//! name every path itself still can; a caller that wants documentation runs
//! `build`.
//!
//! Three flags are deliberately more awkward than the prototype's:
//!
//! - **`--only` and `--only-from` are the same option in two spellings, and
//!   `--only-from` an empty file renders nothing.** `render.ts` could not say
//!   "no modules": zero `--only` flags meant every module, so the incremental
//!   pipeline had to guard the call in shell (plan §5). A regeneration set is
//!   usually empty, so that hole is on the common path.
//! - **One of `--link-index` and `--no-link-index` is required.** The
//!   dependency map is not optional in the product (plan 決定 4); leaving it
//!   out costs 150 of 432 pages their correct bytes, and it does so silently.
//! - **`--root` on a stage command is the package, not the output** (M7-c). It
//!   is what the dependency link map is resolved from, it is optional there
//!   because a stage command may be pointed at an IR tree with no package next
//!   to it, and leaving it out is a *different site* — every link into a
//!   dependency stays a relative link to a page nothing writes. So the run says
//!   which of the two it did, on its own line, rather than letting the answer be
//!   read off the pages. [`build`] has a package by construction and never asks.

  --root         (`build`, `modules`) the Lean package: the sources are globbed
                 under it, its oleans are hashed, `lake env` runs inside it, and
                 for `build` its git HEAD is where --source-url comes from.
                 (`site`, `render`, `global`, `incremental`, `ledger`)
                 optional, and for two things. One is the dependency link map:
                 with it, every link into a dependency is that package's
                 version-pinned GitHub blob URL, read out of its
                 lake-manifest.json plus `lean --githash` (M7-c); without it
                 those links stay relative to pages this site does not write.
                 The other is <root>/litedoc4.toml, which sets the site's title
                 and the Markdown on its index page — the same file for every
                 command, so the four that write HTML cannot disagree about
                 what the package is called. It is **not** --target: that names the
                 tree whose oleans are hashed. A ledger and the run it licenses
                 have to agree about this flag, or the render key moves and
                 every page is re-rendered. `build` has one by construction, so
                 its sites always carry the links.
  --out          (`build`) the directory this command owns: <out>/site is the
                 site, <out>/{ir,state,work} the caches, <out>/ledger.json the
                 ledger. Required, with no default — <root>/.lake/build/doc is
                 doc-gen4's own output tree — and it may not be inside --root
  --port         (`watch`) the port the site is served on (default 8484). A
                 port that is taken is refused by name, never moved to the next
                 free one: an address that changes between runs leaves the tab
                 you already have open pointing at nothing.
  --interval     (`watch`) how often the loop asks the ledger, in milliseconds
                 (default 1000, minimum 100). `watch` **does not run `lake
                 build`** — run that in another window and it notices the oleans
                 it writes. It acts only after one quiet interval, so a build
                 still writing oleans is never extracted mid-flight, and it says
                 so while it waits.
  --full         (`build`) regenerate everything, ignoring what is under --out.
                 The escape hatch for an input no ledger key covers. The
                 dependency map used to be one; since M5-b its bytes are in
                 renderKey, so a map that moved re-renders on its own.
  --ir           an IR tree written by the extractor (schema 5)
  --ir-dir       (`extract`) where the extractor writes that tree. Required and
                 with no default: the extractor's own default was one session's
                 scratchpad path and is gone (M4-a)
  --pages        where the pages go; directories are created
  --source-url   https://host/owner/repo/blob/<40-hex-rev>. `incremental`
                 checks the 40 hex digits; `render` and `site` do not.
  --link-index   the dependency closure's name -> module map (.lidx). Its
                 SHA-256 is part of renderKey: a map that moved re-renders every
                 page (150 of the target's 432 change bytes, plan 決定 4).
                 For `build` it is optional — left out, the map is this
                 command's own <out>/link-index.lidx, written by the extractor
                 from the environment it imported anyway (M5-a). Given, it is an
                 input and is never written to. For `extract` it asks the
                 extractor to write one.
  --deps-docs-url  (`build`) <Root>=<url>: link that dependency's declarations
                 at the documentation site it already publishes, e.g.
                 Mathlib=https://leanprover-community.github.io/mathlib4_docs.
                 Repeatable, off by default, and **verified**: a name that site's
                 declaration table holds gets the docs page, one it does not
                 keeps the version-pinned source, and a table that will not read
                 sends the whole root to the source. There is no fallback on a
                 404 — a build cannot see one. A <Root> that is not a dependency
                 of --root is exit 3.
  --deps-docs-index  (`build`) <Root>=<url|path>: where that site's declaration
                 table is. Default <url>/declarations/declaration-data.bmp. A
                 local path is read as a file, which is how a run with no
                 outbound network uses this.
  --deps-docs-map  (`site`, `render`, `incremental`, `ledger`, `links`) the
                 resolved map `build` wrote under <out>/work. It carries the base
                 URL and the verified names, so the commands that render cannot
                 disagree about the links (the reason there is no --title,
                 frame.rs:66-70). Nothing here reads a table or the network.
                 It is an input to renderKey, so `ledger build` and `ledger
                 check` need it for the same reason --root and --link-index are
                 theirs: without it they compute a different key from the one the
                 run that wrote the pages recorded, and then report a changed or
                 unchanged key for a reason that is not true.
  --link-index-omit  (`extract`, with --link-index) the modules whose own
                 declaration groups are left out of that map, one name per
                 line — normally the package's own module list. The renderer
                 answers those names out of the IR before it reads the map, so
                 the site is byte-identical; what changes is that the map stops
                 moving when the package is edited, and with it renderKey.
                 Module names still appear in the map's `@` section.
                 `incremental --serve` passes its own --modules here.
  --link-index-key  (`extract`, with --link-index) an opaque token standing for
                 everything about that map the extractor cannot see: the oleans
                 behind the imported modules, and the omit list's bytes. With
                 it, a map whose sidecar <file>.key holds the same token and
                 whose `@` section still matches the environment is left
                 untouched — no scan, no write (1.20-1.81 s of a 6.2 s one-module
                 incremental build on the measurement target). Anything less than
                 a full match rewrites both. `build` and `incremental --serve`
                 compute their own; here it is passed through verbatim.
  --make-link-index  (`incremental --serve`) the resident extractor writes
                 --link-index instead of reading it
  --work         (`incremental`) the round's scratch directory. Everything in
                 it is a diagnostic: the pipeline writes it and reads none of
                 it back.
  --extractor    (`incremental`) the extraction program, called as
                 `<program> [<extractor-arg>...] --modules <list>
                 --ir-dir <dir> --timings <file>`. No default, and the seam is
                 what lets the pipeline be tested without Lean. Exclusive with
                 --serve.
  --extractor-arg  one argument for it, before those three; repeatable
  --serve        (`incremental`) one resident Lean environment for the whole
                 run instead of one process per round: imported at the first
                 round that extracts, released on the way out of the loop.
                 There is no --serve-dir — a server this run did not start is
                 one whose olean generation it cannot vouch for.
  --max-rounds   how many extract/ownership/merge rounds may run (default 5).
                 Reaching it with modules still stale is exit 5.
  --root         (`modules`) the repository the sources are globbed under
  --lib          (`build`, `modules`) a library root: <Name>.lean and <Name>/;
                 repeatable. Left out, the names come from <root>/lakefile.toml's
                 [[lean_lib]] blocks; a lakefile.lean is refused by name, because
                 reading it honestly means elaborating it with Lake
  --extractor-bin  (`extract`, `incremental --serve`) the Lean extractor built
                 by extractor/build.sh, or $EXTRACT_BIN. No default: it is built
                 against the target's toolchain, so a baked-in path would be
                 right on one machine
  --target       (`extract`, `incremental --serve`) the Lean package to run
                 inside, or $TARGET_REPO. It is opened read-only: an --ir-dir
                 under it is refused, and its oleans are the generation every
                 resident request is checked against
  --lake         (`extract`, `incremental --serve`) the lake executable, or
                 $LAKE (default: `lake`). Also (`build`, `site`, `render`,
                 `ledger`) where the `lean` that answers `--githash` is looked
                 for: its **sibling**, so `--lake ~/.elan/bin/lake` means
                 `~/.elan/bin/lean`. That revision is Lean core's, the one
                 dependency the manifest does not pin
  --events       (`extract`) the extractor's phase events JSONL. Defaults to
                 <timings without .json>-events.jsonl, which is what
                 `incremental` relies on: it passes only --timings
  --jobs         (`extract`, `incremental --serve`) extractor threads
                 (default 1). It is the resident server's start-up
                 configuration, so there is no per-request job count
  --only         render only this module; repeatable
  --only-from    render only the modules named in this file, one per line.
                 An empty file renders nothing.
  --out          the site root the six whole-package artifacts go under — for
                 `site` the module pages go under it too — or the ledger file
                 `ledger build` writes
  --state        directory holding the contentHash cache (global-state.json).
                 Without it every module is read: the from-scratch build.
  --before       a previous declarations/name-map.json. Turns the delta on.
  --print-set    the modules to re-render, one per line. An affected set that
                 came out empty is an empty file, not a blank line.
  --delta-json   the delta's diagnostic summary
  --timings      one JSON line of counts and durations
  --modules      the module list, one name per line; # comments are skipped.
                 `ledger check` without it re-reads the ledger's own list and
                 cannot see a module that appeared or vanished since `build`.
                 For `merge` it is the order the merged index.json's modules
                 come out in — a from-scratch extraction's, which is the order
                 the extractor was handed the list in. A list that names other
                 modules than the merged tree holds is exit 3, not a guess.
  --target       the repository whose .lake/build/lib/lean holds the oleans.
                 **Not** where the dependency link map comes from — that is

                 the same directory but on a hashed tree with no package behind
                 it only one of them exists
  --ledger       a ledger.json written by `ledger build`. `incremental` reads
                 it and never rewrites it; `build` writes it back, after the
                 last step that could fail.
  --algorithm  sha256 hashes the olean bytes; lake reads the <file>.hash Lake
                 already wrote. Defaults to sha256, and for `check` to the
                 ledger's own.
  --concurrency  olean reads in flight (default 1). The ledger's bytes do not
                 depend on it.
  --changed-out  the modules to re-extract, one per line
  --removed-out  the modules that no longer have an olean, one per line
  --render-all-out  why every page has to be re-rendered, one reason per line.
                 Empty means the render set follows from the IR diff as usual.
  --module       the module `ledger touch` invalidates
  --base         the IR as it was before this round
  --inc          the partial extraction's IR tree. Absent is a real case: a pure
                 deletion re-extracts nothing.
  --removed      modules that no longer exist, one per line (`ownership`)
  --remove       the same list, spelled as the prototype spells it for `merge`
  --exclude      modules already scheduled for re-extraction, one per line.
                 They are fresh by definition and are never reported.
  --verify       compare two IR trees; --against names the second
  --changed      a module that changed; repeatable (`impact`)
  --changed-file the same list in a file, one name per line
  --mode         which modules the change reaches: self, referrers (direct),
                 importers (the sound transitive bound, the default), or all —
                 which is valid with an empty changed set and is what a moved
                 render key selects
  --census       a per-module TSV of |IMPORTERS| / |REFERRERS| / declarations
