//! A target that leaks on purpose, so that a green leak check can be believed.
//!
//! LeakSanitizer does not run on macOS, so the leak question was left open with
//! the machine that could answer it — `ubuntu-latest` — free all along.
//! Running LSan there is easy; knowing
//! that it *ran* is the part that needs this file.
//!
//! `.github/workflows/ci-leak.yml` runs this target first and **fails if it
//! passes**. A leak check that reports nothing looks identical whether the
//! subject is clean or the sanitizer is not linked in, and this is the only way
//! to tell those apart — the same shape as Q6's `CFLAGS` finding, where a fuzzer
//! that reached none of the C looked exactly like a fuzzer that found nothing.
