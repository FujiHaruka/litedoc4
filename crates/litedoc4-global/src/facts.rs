//! Everything the whole-package artifacts need from **one** module.
//!
//! Ported from `experiments/stage7h/global.ts` (frozen at tag
//! `experiments-frozen`): `headConst` (97-106), `autolinkTokens` (111-125) and
//! `factsOf` (148-170) — the same line ranges `tests/oracle/gen-global-expected.ts`
//! sliced to build its oracle before both were removed.
//!
//! # Why this type exists before the cache does
//!
//! [`ModuleFacts`] is ~2 KB per module against 16 MB of module IR, and plan §3
//! says the `contentHash` cache goes in one place rather than five. M2-a builds
//! every fact from scratch on every run; M2-b keys this struct on
//! [`ModuleFacts::content_hash`] and stops re-reading modules whose hash has not
//! moved. Keeping the seam now costs one struct and means the cache is a change
//! to [`crate::facts_for`], not to the derivation.
//!
//! The prototype states the contract in a comment worth restating: **if a fact
//! the derivation reads is not in here, adding it is a cache-version bump, not
//! an edit.** A cache that keeps entries built by an older rule is fast and
//! wrong.
//!
//! # [`ModuleFacts::tokens`] reaches no artifact
//!
//! The artifacts are derived from the other fields. `tokens` exists for the
//! whole-package map delta (M2-b), which asks "does this module's docstrings
//! mention a name that moved". It is built here because it is a per-module fact
//! and the cache boundary is per module — and because it is the one field a byte
//! comparison of the artifacts cannot check at all.
//!
//! # M8-d added a seventh field, and that is a cache-version bump
//!
//! [`ModuleFacts::instances_for`] is the "which instances mention this type"
//! direction of the instance index, which no artifact used to carry. The file
//! that needs it is `instances.json` — it was `search-index.json` when this was
//! written, and search-v2 P0 moved the two instance maps out of the search
//! index. **The heading's "seventh" is M8-d's count and stays that way**: C-2
//! added [`ModuleFacts::refs`] afterwards, so today it is the eighth field. Per the contract above, adding it bumps
//! [`crate::STATE_DERIVATION`] — a state file written by the v1 rule has no such
//! key, and using it would produce a site whose Instances For blocks are empty
//! on every module the cache hit.
