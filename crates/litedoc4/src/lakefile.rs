//! Where `--lib` comes from: the package's own lakefile.
//!
//! Milestone **M4-d**, and M3-d2's fifth debt (plan §7). `litedoc4 modules
//! --root <repo> --lib <Name>` made the caller name the library, with "which
//! libraries a package declares is in its lakefile, and reading one is M4's" as
//! the reason. This is that reading.
//!
//! # What is read, and what is refused by name 【判断】
//!
//! A Lake package declares its libraries in one of two files, and they are not
//! the same kind of thing:
//!
//! * **`lakefile.toml`** — data. `[[lean_lib]]` blocks with a `name` key. That
//!   is what the measurement target has, and it is what this reads.
//! * **`lakefile.lean`** — *code*. `lean_lib` is a Lake DSL command in a Lean
//!   file that Lake elaborates; the library name can come from an `open`ed
//!   namespace, from string interpolation, from an `if`. Reading it honestly
//!   means running Lake, which this command does not do. **It is refused by
//!   name, with `--lib` as the answer** — never parsed hopefully.
//!
//! The same rule runs one level deeper, inside the TOML. This is **not** a TOML
//! parser and does not pretend to be one: it is a recogniser for the exact
//! shape the format's `[[lean_lib]]`/`name` pair is written in, and **every line
//! it cannot account for stops it** rather than being skipped. The failure it is
//! built against is silent under-reading — a `[[lean_lib]]` written in a spelling
//! the recogniser skips produces a *shorter* module list, and a module list that
//! is missing a library looks exactly like a package whose modules were deleted:
//! the pages are simply never written and nothing says so.
//!
//! So the refusals below are deliberately loud, and all of them end in the same
//! sentence — pass `--lib`. A caller with a lakefile this cannot read is never
//! stuck; it is only told to say the name out loud.
//!
//! # `defaultTargets` is not consulted 【判断】
//!
//! Every `[[lean_lib]]` is returned, not the subset `defaultTargets` names. The
//! two answer different questions: `defaultTargets` is what `lake build` builds
//! with no arguments (and it can name executables, which have no modules to
//! document), while this list is "which module roots does this package own". A
//! package that declares a library it does not build by default has no olean for
//! it, and `detect` says so by name (exit 3) — which is a better failure than
//! documenting less than the package has and reporting success.
