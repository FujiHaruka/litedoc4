//! How much of the IR one process read — a **counter, not a clock**.
//!
//! # Why a counter
//!
//! This project's product is speed, and speed has no gate: the oleans are
//! `mmap`ed, so the same run's environment load moves by 5x with the page cache
//! (2.5 s cold ↔ 13 s warm 【実測】, CLAUDE.md). A wall clock measured in CI
//! decides nothing, and a threshold over it is either so loose that a regression
//! passes or so tight that a cold runner fails an unchanged build.
//!
//! What *is* decidable is the **work**: the same input reads the same files, the
//! same number of times, on every machine and in every cache state. Every number
//! here is a deterministic integer, and a change to one of them is a change to
//! what the pipeline does rather than to what the machine felt like doing.
//!
//! # Why here
//!
//! `approach.md` §5.6's claim about this pipeline is in exactly these units —
//! "the outer half's limit is not rendering but **reading the whole IR**, and
//! **five of those reads are left**" — so the counter that checks it has to count
//! the same thing: **IR files opened and parsed**. One full pass over a package
//! is `modules` module-file reads, so `module / modules` is the number of full
//! passes a run made, which is the number §5.6 quotes.
//!
//! It lives beside [`crate::IrTree`] for the reason plan §3 gives for the loader
//! itself: **every read of a module file is in this crate**, so there is one
//! place for the `contentHash` cache that V2 will put in front of the remaining
//! passes — and one place to count what that cache is supposed to remove. A
//! counter sprinkled over the five call sites would be the thing it is
//! measuring: five copies of one decision.
//!
//! **Module files, not the whole IR.** The claim as first written — "every read
//! of the IR is in this crate" — was false, and the counters are what showed it
//!【実測 2026-08-16 → [`crate::read_module_file`]】: three callers read
//! `index.json` from outside. The V2 cache belongs on the module files, so the
//! design stands; the sentence did not.
//!
//! # What is counted, and what is not
//!
//! Counted: every IR file read **into memory and parsed** — `index.json`,
//! `modules/<Module>.json`, `deps/<Package>.json` — wherever the read happens.
//! Three call sites are outside this crate (`litedoc4_incr`'s merge, ledger and
//! prune read `index.json` as plain JSON rather than through [`crate::IrTree`]),
//! and they record here too. A counter that missed one of them would not be
//! wrong by a constant — it would report "unchanged" for a stage that grew a
//! whole extra pass.
//!
//! Not counted: `fs::copy` of a module file (`merge` moving the extracted files
//! into the tree). It transfers bytes without parsing them, and it is
//! proportional to the **changed** set rather than to the package, so folding it
//! in would make a full-pass count that is not a count of full passes.
//!
//! # Process-wide
//!
//! The counters are `static`, so they are the *process's*, not a run's. That is
//! what makes them free at the call site — no plumbing through six stages — and
//! it is why [`reset`] exists: a command that wants "this run's" number says so
//! at its start. `litedoc4 build` is one run per process and resets anyway,
//! because "nothing else ran first" is an assumption and resetting is a fact.
