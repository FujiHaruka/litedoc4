# Consumer.Basic

A handful of documented declarations — enough for the pipeline to produce a page
and for `tools/lake-package-gate.sh` item 3 to have something to close over. Nothing here is
trying to cover a renderer branch; that is `e2e/micro`'s job.

/-- Twice `n`, so the pipeline has a declaration with a signature to print. -/

/-- `Consumer.double` never shrinks its argument. A theorem, so the site has a
declaration whose kind is not `def`. -/
