# Measures whether freshly *written* olean bytes stay in the page cache — i.e. whether a
# CI job that unpacks its olean cache immediately before running the doc extractor starts
# warm rather than cold.
#
# The assumption that CI always starts with a cold page cache carries no label
# and no log. This driver produces the log.
#
#   sizes  sweep a copy payload across sizes that straddle this host's page-cache headroom
#          and record the residency of the *destination* right after the copy finishes.
#          Also records the residency of the *source* — a file-to-file copy asks the cache
#          for twice the payload, which CI's real path (a 411 MiB archive) does not.
#   zeros  the same sweep writing from /dev/zero: no source competes for the cache, so this
#          isolates "how much of a write survives" from "the copy source evicted it".
#   ltar   the real CI path: leantar -x of the current-rev Mathlib cache cluster into a
#          scratch root, then residency of what it wrote.
#   import the same question in seconds: run the stage-1 extractor against a Mathlib that
#          was written moments ago (fresh) / evicted (cold) / already read (warm).
#
# Every step records vm_stat before and after, because on a 16 GiB host under memory
# pressure the answer is a function of headroom, not a constant.
