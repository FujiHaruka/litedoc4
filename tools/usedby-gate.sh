# "Used by", checked against the IR it was derived from — **in both directions**.
#
# WHAT IT ASSERTS
#   For declarations A and B of the same package:
#
#       A's IR mentions B   ⟺   B's entry in declarations/used-by.json holds A
#
#   Both halves, because each catches a failure the other cannot. Only the
#   forward half and a used-by that dropped every second entry still passes on
#   whatever it kept; only the backward half and a used-by that invented users
#   passes on whatever it invented. The pair has no external oracle: the IR is
#   the site's own input, so this is an *invariant* gate.
#
#   See doc-gen4 #77, #63.
#
# WHAT IT DOES NOT ASSERT
#   That a name in the file is a declaration the site has a page for — that is
#   `benchmarks/tools/check-site-closure.py`'s job and it already does it for
#   the other maps. Two gates checking one property is how the second one stops
#   being read.
#
# READING THE TWO SIDES DIFFERENTLY IS THE POINT
#   The expected side is built here, from `refs` in the module IR, by code that
#   shares nothing with `litedoc4-global`: a Python dict of sets against a Rust
#   `HashMap<&str, Vec<&str>>` filled from a per-module `BTreeMap` of indices.
#   An oracle written in the same language with the same design makes the same
#   mistake (CLAUDE.md).
#
# usage: usedby-gate.sh --ir <dir> --site <dir> [--drop <name>]
#          --drop  remove one entry from the artifact before comparing, to see
#                  the gate fail. Never in CI; it is how the gate was falsified.
