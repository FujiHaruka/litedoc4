//! Lean module names: the two spellings, and where each one is right.
//!
//! Milestone **M5-b**, and it exists because the second target broke on it.
//! Plan §7 (M5-a, trap 4) recorded the hazard as a note — "the `.lidx` writer
//! spells declaration names with `Name.toString` and module names without
//! escaping; the two coincide on this target and a target with `«…»` in a module
//! name would break quietly". A module named `Alpha.«Odd-Name»` was put into
//! target 2 to find out, and **it does not break quietly**: the extractor exits
//! 1 with `import failed, trying to import module with anonymous name` before
//! it imports anything 【実測 2026-08-15】.
//!
//! # The mechanism, read out of the toolchain rather than guessed
//!
//! `litedoc4 modules` derives the list from a **glob over the sources**, so a
//! name is built out of path components: `Alpha/Odd-Name.lean` becomes
//! `Alpha.Odd-Name`. The extractor turns each line back into a `Name` with
//! `String.toName` (`Extract.lean:readNameList`), and that function is a
//! *parser*: `Substring.Raw.toName` splits on `.` and accepts a component only
//! if it is an identifier, an escaped `«…»`, or a numeral
//! (`Init/Meta/Defs.lean:1218-1233`). `Odd-Name` is none of the three, so the
//! whole list entry parses as `Name.anonymous` — and importing the anonymous
//! module is the error above.
//!
//! So the two spellings are not interchangeable, and which one is canonical is
//! not a choice:
//!
//! | | spelling | who fixes it |
//! |---|---|---|
//! | **the name** | `Alpha.«Odd-Name»` | the extractor writes it into `index.json` and into `modules/<name>.json` (`Extract.lean:2168`, `ToString Name` = escaping on), and `merge --modules` refuses a list that disagrees with the tree (M3-d2b, exit 3) |
//! | **the path** | `Alpha/Odd-Name` | the olean is at the source's path, and doc-gen4 builds a page path out of `Name.toString (escape := false)` components (`Output/Base.lean:188`) |
//!
//! Hence [`escape_module`], which the glob applies once, and
//! [`module_components`] / [`fn@module_path`], which every path derivation goes
//! through.
//!
//! # This is inert on the measurement target 【実測】
//!
//! All 432 of its module names are plain identifiers, so escaping and
//! unescaping are both the identity there and not one recorded byte moves.
//! `tests/name.rs` asserts that over the real module list rather than assuming
//! it.
//!
//! # What is transcribed, and from where
//!
//! [`is_id_first`] / [`is_id_rest`] / [`is_letter_like`] / [`is_subscript_alnum`]
//! are `Init/Meta/Defs.lean:98-137` of the toolchain target 2 and the
//! measurement target both pin (`leanprover/lean4:v4.31.0`). Note that Lean's
//! `Char.isAlpha` and `Char.isAlphanum` are **ASCII only** — every non-ASCII
//! identifier character comes from the two range tables, which is why they are
//! written out here rather than reached for in a Unicode crate. A crate would
//! bring a different UCD and the same class of divergence plan §5 already
//! registers for the general-category tables.
