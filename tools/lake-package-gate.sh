#!/usr/bin/env bash
# Is litedoc4 usable as a Lake dependency? A consumer writes
# `require «litedoc4»` and runs `lake run docs -- --out <dir>`; what that buys is
# the two flags nobody can supply by hand — `--extractor-bin` (Lake builds the
# extractor against the consumer's toolchain) and `--lib` (read out of the
# elaborated workspace, the only honest way to read a `lakefile.lean`).
#
# What a failing item means:
#   1 WIRED     `lake script list` in `e2e/consumer` does not offer
#               `litedoc4/docs`: the dependency's lakefile.lean is not loaded.
#   2 IT RUNS   `lake run docs` wrote no site: the arguments the script
#               assembles are wrong.
#   3 IT CLOSES `tools/site-gate.sh` found that site inconsistent.
#   4 SAME IR   the extractor Lake builds and the one `extractor/build.sh`
#               builds write different IR over `e2e/micro`.
#   5 --lib     the run passed no `--lib` and the site does not document every
#               library root the fixture declares: the Lake-side lookup broke.
#
# Item 4 compares **IR, not binaries**: Lake prefixes package-local symbols and
# compiles the generated C with `-O3 -DNDEBUG`, so the two builds differ by
# +308,032 B (measured 2026-08-18,
# benchmarks/results/lake-package-probe-2026-08-18.txt §2). The fixture is
# `e2e/micro` because it carries declaration shapes the measurement target does
# not have, and a comparison is only as good as the shapes that reach it.
#
# Everything written goes under $OUT, `e2e/micro/.lake/` or `<repo>/.lake/`.
#
# usage: lake-package-gate.sh [--out DIR] [--keep]
#   --out   working directory (default: a temporary one, removed on success)
#   --keep  do not remove a temporary --out
#
#   LITEDOC4  the `litedoc4` executable under test (default: target/debug/litedoc4)
#   LAKE      the lake executable (default: ~/.elan/bin/lake)
