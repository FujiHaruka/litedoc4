# Measures how many olean bytes an extractor run pulls into the page cache.
#
# Takes a residency snapshot (mincore, see olean-residency.c) before any run, then
# alternates "run the extractor" / "take a snapshot". Snapshot 1 minus snapshot 0 is
# the cold run's page-in volume; later snapshots show what the warm runs add.
#
# With EVICT=1 the olean pages are dropped first (olean-evict.c), so the cold state is
# produced on demand and *verified* by R0 rather than assumed from "first run of the
# session". Without it, only the very first extractor run after a long idle is cold.
#
# `RUN_CMD` has no default. Every committed `ci-residency-*` number came from
# `experiments/stage1/run.sh <name>`, which only exists at tag
# `experiments-frozen`; **HEAD has no equivalent**, so those numbers cannot be
# reproduced from this tree. Whoever measures has to name the workload, and a run
# driven by any other workload is a NEW baseline, not a continuation of the
# recorded one.
#
# usage: RUN_CMD='<cmd>' measure-residency.sh <paths.txt> <snapdir> [runs]
#          runs defaults to 6. RUN_CMD is invoked once per E-step as `$RUN_CMD <name>`,
#          where <name> is "$NAME_PREFIX$i" (the recorded runs used NAME_PREFIX to name
#          their JSONL under benchmarks/results/).
#        EVICT=1 ...                                            evict before R0
