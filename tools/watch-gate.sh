#!/usr/bin/env bash
# A-2 — `litedoc4 watch` notices one changed module, rebuilds exactly that much,
# and serves it.
#
# WHAT IT PROVES WHEN IT FAILS, IN ONE LINE
#   Either "the loop rebuilt the wrong amount of work" — naming the count it got
#   and the count it expected — or "the loop rebuilt the wrong module", naming
#   both; or the server did not answer the page the rebuild had just written.
#
# WHY IT IS A GATE AND NOT A TEST
#   It needs a real Lean environment and a real extractor: what it proves is that
#   the loop does one module's worth of work against oleans Lean actually wrote.
#   `cargo test --workspace` reaches neither.
#
#   **It does not need the measurement target, and never did** 【実測 2026-08-24
#   → benchmarks/results/watch-gate-e2e-2026-08-24.txt】. `--target`, `--lib`,
#   `--module`, `--other` and `EXTRACT_BIN` are all arguments, so the same gate
#   runs against `e2e/micro` — Lean core, ten modules, no Mathlib — in seconds
#   (4.0 s and 6.1 s over two runs; wall clock, asserted on by nothing), and
#   `.github/workflows/ci.yml`'s `e2e-micro` job runs it there on every push.
#   The defaults below still name the measurement target because that is the
#   workload the numbers in `benchmarks/` come from.
#
#   What the tests own is everything the loop does that a `/bin/sh` extractor can
#   stand in for: the four arms of one pass, the banner, the server, and a failed
#   rebuild that is said once and waited out
#   (`crates/litedoc4/tests/watch.rs`) — plus the two halves that own their input
#   outright, the decision function and the question it asks
#   (`crates/litedoc4/src/watch.rs`) and the server's routing and refusals
#   (`crates/litedoc4/src/httpd.rs`).
#
# THE ASSERTIONS ARE INTEGERS. NOT ONE OF THEM IS A DURATION.
#   This workload's environment load moves 5x with the page cache (2.5 s <-> 13 s
#   【実測】, CLAUDE.md), so a second is not a threshold — a bound loose enough to
#   pass a cold runner passes a regression too, and one tight enough to catch a
#   regression fails on a cold runner. What one edit costs in *work* does not move:
#
#     modulesExtracted   == 1     the touched module, and only it
#     pagesRendered      == 1     its own page (mode self, empty map delta)
#     extractorRequests  == 1     Lean was started once, not once per round
#     render-set.txt     == that module, by name
#
#   The fourth is the one the first three cannot give: a run that re-extracted
#   one module and re-rendered one page could have done it to the wrong one, and
#   three integers would all be green. It is read from the pipeline's own
#   diagnostic rather than recomputed here.
#
#   The wall clock is printed, because a person reading this wants to know, and
#   is asserted on by nothing.
#
# HOW THE MODULE IS "TOUCHED", AND WHY NOT WITH `touch`
#   `touch` moves an mtime, and the ledger hashes **content** (sha256), so it
#   would change nothing. Rewriting the olean would change something — the
#   measurement target, which nothing in this repository is allowed to write to
#   (CLAUDE.md). So the change is injected into this run's own copy of the ledger
#   with `litedoc4 ledger touch`, which exists for exactly this reason
#   (`crates/litedoc4/src/main.rs`: "the measurement target must not be modified,
#   so 'module M changed' is injected into the ledger instead"). What the loop
#   sees is what it would see after a real `lake build` of that module: its
#   ledger entry no longer matches the olean on disk.
#
#   The ledger being written is `$OUT/build/ledger.json`, which this script's own
#   build wrote. Nothing under the target is opened for writing.
#
# HOW TO MAKE IT FAIL ON PURPOSE (and it has been, 【実測 2026-08-19】)
#     --inject wrong-module   touch a **different** module from the one the
#                             assertions expect. The three counts stay 1/1/1 —
#                             the loop did exactly one module's worth of work —
#                             and the name check is the only thing that catches
#                             it, which is the whole reason it is here.
#     --inject no-touch       touch nothing at all and still wait for a rebuild:
#                             the gate must time out and say so rather than
#                             report a green run it never saw.
#   Both break only files under this script's work area. The repository, the
#   target and their ledgers are not touched, and no `git checkout` is involved.
#
# WHAT IT REFUSES BEFORE IT STARTS
#   Another `litedoc4 watch` already using this work area or this port. `watch`
#   outlives the shell that started it, so one from an interrupted session is
#   still rewriting the IR this script is about to read and recreating the files
#   its cleanup is about to delete — which is reported as a corrupt IR tree and
#   as `rm: Directory not empty` respectively 【実測 2026-08-21】. It is named
#   and refused (exit 2), never killed: killing a process this script does not
#   own is not a gate's call.

#   --port     the port `watch` binds (default 8485, one above `watch`'s own
#              default so that a gate run does not collide with a person's)

#   * it rewrites the IR while this script's build reads it — the gate fails with
