//! The static assets a page needs to look like a page, carried in the binary.
//!
//! Milestone **M8-a**, and the whole of `docs/plans/ui-redesign.md` 決定 6. Up
//! to here the renderer *referenced* assets it never produced: [`crate::frame`]
//! writes `<link rel="stylesheet" href="…style.css">` into all 432 pages and
//! nothing under the site root has ever answered it. A tree that has to be
//! completed by hand before it can be opened is not a tree `litedoc4 build`
//! finished.
//!
//! # Why the bytes are in the binary rather than next to it
//!
//! `include_str!`, so a build produces one file to install and — the part that
//! is about correctness rather than convenience — **the assets cannot be a
//! version behind the renderer**. The CSS is coupled to class names
//! [`crate::decl`] and [`crate::frame`] emit; a stylesheet shipped separately
//! can be the one from before those names moved, and the failure is a page that
//! renders with half its rules silently not matching. Two things in one binary
//! cannot drift.
//!
//! # Two of the three are written by hand; `app.js` is built
//!
//! `style.css` and `favicon.svg` are the bytes in `assets/`. **`app.js` is
//! not** — it is the bundle `build.rs` compiles from the TypeScript in `web/`,
//! read out of cargo's `OUT_DIR` (`docs/plans/assets-typescript.md` 決定 1).
//! The same argument as above, one level down: a committed bundle can be a
//! version behind `web/src`, and one that is built on the way past cannot.
//! What it costs is node, at build time, for whoever builds from source.
//!
//! # These are **not** in `renderKey`, and that is a decision
//!
//! The incremental ledger's render key exists to answer "would this page's
//! bytes come out differently now" (`docs/implementation-plan.md`,
//! `litedoc4_incr::render_key`). **A page's bytes do not depend on these
//! files** — it names them in an `href` and the href does not carry their
//! content — so putting them in the key would re-render 432 pages every time a
//! CSS rule moved and buy nothing at all. The other half of the decision is
//! what pays for it: [`write_assets`] runs on **every** build, full or
//! incremental, so the tree is never carrying yesterday's stylesheet either.
//!
//! # What is here, and what is still a placeholder
//!
//! | | referenced by | written by |
//! |---|---|---|
//! | `style.css` | [`crate::head_html`] | M8-b |
//! | `app.js` | [`crate::head_html`] | M8-c |
//! | `favicon.svg` | [`crate::head_html`] (`icon`) | M8-a |
//!
//! # One test here is about the stylesheet rather than the plumbing
//!
//! This module's `every_class_the_renderer_emits_is_styled` test — not a link,
//! because `#[cfg(test)]` items are invisible to rustdoc — compares the class
//! names in the renderer's string literals against the selectors in `style.css`.
//! It lives here because this is where the two sides meet, and it exists because
//! the failure it catches is **silent**: a class renamed in `decl.rs` still
//! renders, still validates, and simply has no styling. Nothing else in the suite
//! opens a browser, so nothing else would ever notice.
