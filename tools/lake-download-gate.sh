# L2 — does `resolveLitedoc4` really fetch the Rust half from a GitHub Release?
#
# `docs/plans/lake-package.md` §5 adds two sources to the lakefile's
# `resolveLitedoc4`: a version-pinned cache and a checksum-verified download from
# the release that matches this tree's `Cargo.toml`. This gate is the only place
# either of them is executed.
#
# WHY THIS GATE EXISTS SEPARATELY FROM tools/lake-package-gate.sh
#   That gate sets `LITEDOC4_BIN`, which is source 1, so it returns before
#   sources 2..5 are reached — it has never run a single line of this code
#   【実測 2026-08-18】. **This gate must therefore never set `LITEDOC4_BIN`.**
#   Setting it would turn every item below into a check of nothing, and the
#   output would look exactly the same.
#
# THERE ARE TWO WORLDS, AND A RUN SAYS WHICH ONE IT WAS IN
#   `lakefile.lean` looks the binary up by the version in **this tree's**
#   `Cargo.toml`, so whether a release exists for it is a property of the
#   checkout, not of the machine:
#
#     ON A RELEASE TAG        a release carries v<version>. Items 1 and 2 are
#                             the download and the cache, exactly as written.
#     ON main, MID-CYCLE      no release carries v<version> — the normal state
#                             of a tree that is ahead of the last release. There
#                             is nothing to download, so items 1 and 2 grade the
#                             **documented fall-through** instead: source 3 says
#                             the asset is not there, PATH answers, a site is
#                             written, and nothing lands in the cache.
#
#   In the second world the summary and the final verdict both say **the
#   download path was NOT EXERCISED**, the way `tools/deps-docs-gate.sh` says it
#   of its branch 2. Reporting `ok` for a path that never ran is the failure this
#   repository has shipped four spellings of (CLAUDE.md 「skip で緑を返さない」);
#   reporting FAILED would be the opposite lie, because the mechanism is not
#   broken — it was not run.
#
#   Which world it is, is decided **once, up front**, by asking the asset URL for
#   its status: 200 is a release, 404 is no release, and anything else — curl
#   unable to reach GitHub at all — is a hard exit 2. Offline is a failure of
#   this gate, not a third world.
#
# THE FIVE ITEMS
#   1 DOWNLOAD   an empty cache + the real network: the release archive is
#                fetched, its SHA-256 is checked against the published
#                checksums.txt, the binary lands in the cache and builds a site.
#                Falls: the download path is broken, or the release moved.
#                *No release*: source 3 announces that there is no asset for
#                this version, PATH answers, a site is still written and the
#                cache stays empty. Falls: it goes quiet, does not fall through,
#                or writes nothing.
#   2 CACHED     the same cache with **curl replaced by one that always fails**:
#                the second run must not need the network at all. Falls: the
#                cache is not being consulted (judged by whether curl was
#                invoked, not by whether a line was printed).
#                *No release*: the mirror image — item 1 cached nothing, so the
#                second run **must** reach for curl again and fall through
#                again. Falls: a failed download was remembered as a cache hit.
#   3 CHECKSUM   a curl that serves an archive with a **wrong**
#                checksums.txt: the run must fail, leave nothing in the cache
#                and execute nothing it downloaded. Falls: verification is
#                decorative. The archive is the released one where there is a
#                release and a locally built one otherwise; either way it is a
#                **valid** archive that is really hashed and really disagrees,
#                so nothing about the product's verification is stubbed.
#   4 NO-DL      `LITEDOC4_NO_DOWNLOAD=1` with an empty cache: source 3 is
#                skipped, out loud, and source 4 (PATH) answers. Falls: the
#                opt-out does not opt out, or does it silently.
#   5 NO ASSET   a target the releases do not carry: source 3 says so and falls
#                through. Falls: a machine with no asset would hang, guess, or
#                fail instead of moving on. Releases carry two targets on
#                purpose (`.github/workflows/release.yml`), so this is a normal
#                path for every other machine, not an error path.
#
# HOW THE NETWORK IS CONTROLLED
#   Items 2..5 put a shim `curl` first on PATH which logs every invocation. That
#   is what "did not download" is judged by: a run that printed nothing about
#   downloading but still called curl would fail here. Item 1 uses the real one.
#
# WHAT IS NEVER TOUCHED
#   **The user's ~/.cache.** Every run sets XDG_CACHE_HOME to a directory under
#   $OUT, so nothing outside $OUT is written or removed. Also not touched:
#   /Users/haruka/dev/lean-projects, and `$LITEDOC4_BIN` (see above).
#
# usage: lake-download-gate.sh [--out DIR] [--keep]
#   --out   working directory (default: a temporary one, removed on success)
#   --keep  do not remove a temporary --out
#
#   LITEDOC4  a `litedoc4` executable to put **on PATH** for the items where
#             source 4 is the one that has to answer — 4 and 5 always, and 1 and
#             2 as well where no release carries this version (default:
#             target/debug/litedoc4). It is never exported as LITEDOC4_BIN.
