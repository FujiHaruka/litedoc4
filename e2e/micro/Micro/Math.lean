# Math

Docstring mathematics, which `litedoc4-md` converts to MathML at build time.
doc-gen4 leaves the dollars in the page for MathJax to find in the browser;
nothing here loads a script.

The four declarations below are the four answers, and the last one is the one
that matters: **a span the LaTeX parser refuses is written back as its source**,
so the page is never worse than doc-gen4's. The build counts those and prints
the count, because a page full of unconverted formulas is otherwise
indistinguishable from a page full of converted ones.

This module is a separate file for the same reason `Micro/Sorry.lean` is: it is
the only place where the *whole* path — Lean docstring, extractor, IR, renderer
— is walked for math, and a hand-written IR fixture cannot show that md4c's
`MD_FLAG_LATEXMATHSPANS` saw a `$` where Lean put one.

The measurement target has **three** math spans in 5,079 docstrings, so it could
never have exercised this 【実測 2026-08-22 →
