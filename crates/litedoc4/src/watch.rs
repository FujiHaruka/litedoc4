//! `litedoc4 watch` — keep the site current while the package is being edited,

//!
//! Feature sweep **A-2**, from doc-gen4 #389 ("local build does not refresh
//! after code change", where a commenter writes that coming from Rust one could
//! expect the edit-to-page cycle to be *below one second, not above ten
//! minutes*) and #404 ("hangs indefinitely", which turned out to be Lean core's
//! documentation still being generated in the background). **The algorithm
//! existed already**: `litedoc4 build` rebuilds a no-op package in 0.31 s and a
//! one-declaration edit in 4.35 s 【実測, `docs/plans/feature-sweep.md` §4】.
//! What was missing is the loop, the server, and saying out loud what is
//! happening.
//!
//! ```text
//!   ask the ledger  ──no work──>  idle
//!         │
//!    work │
//!         v
//!   is the answer the same as last tick?  ──no──>  a build is in flight; say so
//!         │ yes
//!         v
//!   did the last pass already act on it?  ──yes──> nothing new; stay quiet
//!         │ no
//!         v
//!   `litedoc4 build`, and one line saying what it cost
//! ```
//!
//! # It does not run `lake build` 【判断】
//!
//! The division of labour everywhere else in this project is that **the user (or
//! the GitHub action) builds the package and litedoc4 reads the oleans**;
//! `watch` keeps it. Building inside the loop would give this one command a job
//! no other command has, and would put a Lean compile — with its own errors, its
//! own output and its own idea of what to do when it fails — inside a loop whose
//! whole purpose is to be predictable. So: run `lake build` in another window.
//! This says so in `--help`, in the start-up banner and in the README, because
//! it is the first thing anyone will ask.
//!
//! # The trigger is the ledger, not a timestamp 【判断】
//!
//! "Which modules are stale" already has an answer in this tree —
//! [`litedoc4_incr::check_ledger`], the same call `build` makes — and a second
//! answer derived from mtimes would be a second definition of *changed* that
//! could disagree with the first. It cannot be allowed to: the disagreement's
//! quiet direction is a watch loop that never rebuilds. So the loop **asks**, and
//! what it asks is the product's own question.
//!
//! # Asking on a timer, and why there is no file-system watcher 【判断】
//!
//! There is no `notify` crate and no `FSEvents`/`inotify`/`ReadDirectoryChanges`
//! of our own. Three reasons, in order of weight:
//!
//! 1. **An event is only ever a hint.** Whatever wakes the loop up, the answer
//!    still comes from the ledger — so an event-driven build would be *this*
//!    loop with a different alarm clock, and the alarm clock is the part that
//!    behaves differently on each operating system.
//! 2. **One path, not two.** `docs/plans/feature-sweep.md` A-2 says a watcher
//!    that splits into "events where available, polling otherwise" is two code
//!    paths that behave differently on different machines, which is exactly what
//!    this project refuses elsewhere. Polling is not the fallback here; it is the
//!    path.
//! 3. **The cost is measured and small** — `benchmarks/results/watch-2026-08-21.txt`.
//!    An idle pass is one `check_ledger` over the target's 422 modules — 228 MB of
//!    oleans, 0.13 s warm.
//!
//! The price is stated rather than hidden: an edit is noticed up to
//! [`Flags::interval`] late, on top of the `lake build` the user is waiting for
//! anyway.
//!
//! # One quiet interval before extracting
//!
//! A pass acts only when the ledger's answer is **the same as the previous
//! pass's**. That is what "a build is in flight" looks like from here: while
//! `lake build` is writing oleans the answer keeps moving, and extracting into
//! that would either produce a site made of two half-worlds or be stopped by the
//! resident extractor's own generation guard (`crate::resident`, exit 3). One
//! interval of quiet is the cost; the alternative is starting a 3 GB Lean import
//! against a directory that is still being written.
//!
//! # The resident extractor does **not** survive a pass 【実測, stage 6a】
//!
//! This is the one place where what was built differs from what A-2 planned, and
//! the reason is not an implementation shortcut. A resident extractor is one
//! imported Lean environment, and **Lean cannot swap a module out of an imported
//! environment** (`Extract.lean:2716-2721`, quoted in `crate::resident`). A pass
//! only ever extracts when the oleans have moved — that is what made it a pass —
//! so a server held over from the previous pass is, by construction, a server
//! whose environment is exactly the one that just went stale. Keeping it alive
//! across passes would buy nothing on the passes that do work, and the passes
//! that do no work never start it at all ([`crate::resident::Resident`] starts
//! lazily). What residency does buy is unchanged and still bought: **within** a
//! pass, the ownership/merge rounds share one import.
//!
//! # What a failed pass does
//!
//! It says what failed and then **waits for the world to move again** before
//! trying the same thing. A loop that retried immediately would start a 3 GB
//! import every interval for as long as the failure lasted, which is the shape
//! #404 was mistaken for. The first pass is the exception: it fails the command,
//! because until it succeeds there is no site to serve and no state to continue
//! from.
