# Does a generated site close over itself? — the gate that outlived gate A.
#
# Byte reproduction against doc-gen4 ended at M8: the UI is ours, so no third
# party knows what these bytes should be. What
# survives the loss of an external oracle is what the tree can be asked about
# itself, and that is the two checks run here. Neither needs the network, the
# corpus, or doc-gen4.
#
#   check-dead-links.py    every relative href resolves to a file in the tree
#   check-site-closure.py  the module index, the search index and the pages
#                          agree about which declarations exist, in *both*
#                          directions, and nothing loads an external resource
#
# The two directions matter. An index that is a subset of the pages passes one
# of them, pages that are a subset of the index pass the other, and both are
# exactly how a renderer and an index generator drift apart.
