//! Build the site's `app.js` from the TypeScript in `web/`.
//!
//! **There is no committed bundle.**
//! `web/src` is the only copy of this code in the repository, and
//! [`crate::assets`] picks the bundle out of cargo's `OUT_DIR`, so it cannot be
//! a version behind its sources — which also means there is no freshness gate
//! to write and no "forgot to commit the build output" to diagnose.
//!
//! The cost is that **node is a build dependency of this crate**. It is paid by
//! whoever builds from source (developers and CI); litedoc4 itself ships as the
//! prebuilt archives `release.yml` produces, and the workspace is
//! `publish = false`.
//!
//! There is deliberately **no fallback**. A tree without node does not quietly
//! use yesterday's bundle — it fails here, saying what to install. Two ways of
//! answering "where does app.js come from" is the shape where only one of them
//! ever gets fixed.
