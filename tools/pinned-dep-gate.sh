# The shape no fixture had: a **version-pinnable dependency whose module names
# need guillemets**.
#
# `e2e/micro-dep` is required by *path*, so its manifest entry has no `url` and
# no `rev`, so `crates/litedoc4/src/packages.rs` cannot build a `/blob/<rev>`
# for it, so every reference to it renders as text with no link. That branch is
# checked by `tools/e2e-micro.sh`. What it cannot check is the other half: when
# the dependency *can* be pinned, the guillemets have to come off on the way
# into the URL, and the three spellings a docstring can use for the same module
# have to agree about where they point. `e2e/README.md` said so and called the
# instance missing.
#
# **Building it is what showed that they did not agree.** `Dep-Aux.Basic` — the
# `.lidx`\'s spelling — resolved nowhere, and only a *pinnable* dependency can
# make that visible: with an unpinnable one all three spellings render as plain
# text, so they agree by accident.
#
# It was not missing for want of hardware. The same `e2e/micro-dep` is the
# fixture; only the **wiring** changes, which is what makes the comparison worth
# anything — the modules, the docstrings and the toolchain are identical to the
# path-required run, and pinnability is the only variable.
#
# # Two things this script does that are not decoration
#
#   the git remote     Lake clones from the `url` it writes into the manifest,
#                      so a `file://` remote would put `file://` into every blob
#                      URL. That is not the shape under test, and it also makes
#                      `tools/site-gate.sh` call those links *internal* and
#                      report five dead ones — a failure of the harness that
#                      reads exactly like a failure of the product. `git`'s
#                      `insteadOf` is used instead: the manifest carries
#                      `https://example.invalid/micro-dep` and the clone still
#                      happens offline, from a repository this script builds.
#
#   the commit         made with fixed author, committer and dates, so the rev
#                      is a function of `e2e/micro-dep`'s contents. Nothing
#                      pins the hash — the gate reads it back out of the
#                      manifest and requires *that* to be what it built.
