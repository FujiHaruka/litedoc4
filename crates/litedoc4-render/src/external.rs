//! Where a **dependency's** source lives: a version-pinned GitHub blob URL.
//!
//! This module answers *where a dependency's source is* and nothing else. Which
//! shape of link a page draws is [`crate::autolink::NameIndex::link_to`]'s
//! single decision, because some of the shapes need a fact this map does not
//! hold — whether the run wrote a page.
//!
//! The rule is doc-gen4's: every page of its reference tree already carries the
//! URL this builds, with an `#L<a>-L<b>` anchor on every one of 241,553 entries
//! over 6,080 pages (measured 2026-08-16 → `benchmarks/results/m7a-summary.txt`).
//! So a lookup needs only **which prefix a module's first component belongs
//! to** — mathlib's is the manifest's `url` plus its 40-hex `rev`, core's
//! carries a `/src` on the end because that is where the lean4 checkout keeps
//! its libraries. The map is resolved elsewhere, and the **path within it is
//! [`crate::frame::module_source_url`]**, the same function the page's own
//! source link is built with.
//!
//! The map has an identity because its contents reach every rendered page, so
//! it is an input to the render key (`litedoc4_incr::render_key`): a bumped
//! dependency moves a `rev`, which moves the href of every link into that
//! dependency, and a run whose only changed input was this map has to re-render
//! rather than report success.
//!
//! The target package's own root is deliberately **not** here — a map that does
//! not hold the root cannot resolve it, so leaving this package's own links
//! alone is structural rather than a rule at the call site.
//!
//! **A dependency with no `/blob/<rev>` is a third state, not the first one.**
//! Absence would otherwise carry both "this package's own module" and "a
//! dependency nothing could be resolved for", and the second is a bug: a `path`
//! dependency, or one pinned at a tag, has no version-pinned URL, so every link
//! into it becomes a **relative link to a page this site never writes** — three
//! dead links per shape (the import list, a docstring's name reference, a
//! signature's constant) (measured 2026-08-17). Such a root is carried **with an
//! empty base** and [`crate::autolink::NameIndex::link_to`] answers `None`: a
//! link to the wrong page is worse than no link. It is *not* the case of a
//! declaration with no line range inside a package that **is** pinned — there
//! the file's URL is still right.
//!
//! **A dependency that publishes documentation is a fourth state** —
//! [`DepDocs`], where a reader lands on a page with the signature, the
//! docstring and the instances instead of on a `.lean` file. That is not simply
//! better, because such a site is built from one revision (mathlib4_docs from
//! `master`, with no versioned copy (measured 2026-08-19,
//! `benchmarks/results/deps-link-rot-2026-08-19.txt` §9)) while the manifest
//! pins another, so a name this package refers to may not be on it: **0 of 396
//! Mathlib names missing at a two month pin (measured), 10.3 of 396 expected at
//! twelve (extrapolated)**. So the state carries the site's **declaration table** and
//! the rule is one rule rather than a fallback chain: the table holds the name
//! ⇒ the docs page at the table's own `docLink`; it does not ⇒ the
//! version-pinned source; there is no table ⇒ the version-pinned source. A run
//! never tries the docs site and recovers from a 404 — nothing here can see
//! one, and a link that 404s is what the pin was protecting against. Module
//! links are answered the same way out of the table's `modules` section.
