//! `litedoc4 build` — a Lean package in, a documentation site out, in one
//! command.
//!
//! Milestone **M4-d**, and the gate of M4. Every stage this drives already
//! exists; what did not exist is **the thing that knows what to call them
//! with**. Before this command a caller had to know, and get right, all of:
//!
//! ```text
//!   litedoc4 modules --root <repo> --lib <Name>       > modules.txt
//!   litedoc4 extract --modules modules.txt --ir-dir <ir> --timings <t>
//!   litedoc4 site    --ir <ir> --out <site> --source-url <url> --link-index …
//!   litedoc4 ledger  build --modules modules.txt --target <repo> --ir <ir> …
//!   # …and on the second commit, a different five commands, with --state and
//!   # --ledger and --work threaded between them in the right order
//! ```
//!
//! — plus the two answers nothing in that list computes: **which library the
//! package declares** (M3-d2's debt 5, now [`crate::lakefile`]) and **what
//! `--source-url` is** (the prototype writes a 40-hex revision into a shell
//! variable by hand, `incremental.sh:106` / `run.sh:55`, which plan §6 lists as
//! one of the last hard-coded values). And it had to choose, correctly, between
//! the full path and the incremental one.
//!
//! `build` is those decisions, in this order:
//!
//! ```text
//!   1  --lib          the lakefile's [[lean_lib]] names, unless given
//!   2  the modules    the source glob (`litedoc4 modules`), one list, reused
//!   3  --source-url   git HEAD + the origin remote, unless given
//!   4  the layout     what is under --out already, and whether it is complete
//!   5a first run      hash → extract everything → site → write the ledger
//!   5b later runs     hash → the incremental pipeline → write the ledger
//! ```
//!
//! # Where things go, and why there is no default for `--out` 【判断】
//!
//! `--out <dir>` is **required**, and the directory is the command's own:
//!
//! ```text
//!   <out>/site/                the site — 432 module pages + 7 whole-package
//!                              artifacts (M8-d) + 3 static assets (M8-a) on
//!                              the target. This is what ships.
//!   <out>/ir/                  the IR tree (16 MB), carried between runs
//!   <out>/state/               global-state.json, the contentHash cache
//!   <out>/ledger.json          which oleans the IR was built from
//!   <out>/work/                one run's diagnostics; read by nobody
//!   <out>/litedoc4-build.json  the marker below
//! ```
//!
//! **There is no default, and in particular the default is not
//! `<root>/.lake/build/doc`** — which is where doc-gen4 writes, and where this
//! project's target holds a 736 MB reference tree that took about nine hours to
//! produce. A default that overwrites another tool's output tree is a data-loss
//! bug with a friendly face; and this repository has already paid for one baked
//! path (`defaultIrDir`, M4-a) and for one relative path that resolved inside
//! the package being documented (M4-c). Naming the output is one word, and it is
//! the word that says where megabytes are about to land.
//!
//! **`--out` may not be inside `--root`.** `litedoc4 extract` already refuses an
//! `--ir-dir` under its `--target`, because the package being documented is
//! opened read-only; since the IR lives under `--out`, an `--out` inside the
//! package would be refused one stage later and with a worse message. Stating it
//! here means the run stops before it has written anything at all. A caller who
//! wants the site *inside* the repository copies `<out>/site` there — one `cp
//! -R` of the thing that ships, without 16 MB of IR and a cache landing in
//! somebody's working tree.
//!
//! # The marker, and how a half-finished run is recognised
//!
//! `<out>/litedoc4-build.json` is written **twice** per run: `complete: false`
//! before anything else, `complete: true` after the ledger. It records the
//! layout version, the root it was built from, the libraries and — on the second
//! write only — [`WorkCounts`], **how much work the run did**, which is the one
//! thing about this command's performance that can be gated in CI (see that
//! type). It is what makes the choice in step 4 answerable rather than guessed:
//!
//! * `--out` absent or empty → **full generation**;
//! * marker present, `complete: true`, and the ledger, IR, state and site all
//!   there → **incremental**;
//! * marker present and `complete: false`, or a piece missing → **full
//!   generation**, and the site tree is removed first (see below);
//! * **`--out` not empty and no marker → exit 3.** This command deletes and
//!   overwrites inside `--out`, so it will only do that to a directory it can
//!   see it wrote. "It looked empty enough" is not a reason to remove somebody's
//!   files.
//! * marker present naming a **different `--root`** → exit 3. The ledger stores
//!   the target it hashed; carrying it over to another package would compare one
//!   package's oleans with another's hashes and re-extract everything, or worse,
//!   not.
//!
//! The site tree is removed before a full generation because **the renderer only
//! ever writes**: a module that vanished between two full runs would keep its
//! page for ever, and the page tree would carry a file no from-scratch run
//! produces. Deletion is confined to `<out>/site`, and only when the marker says
//! this command created it.
//!
//! # When the ledger is written — the one ordering that has a silent failure
//!
//! The ledger's claim is "**the IR was built from these oleans, and the pages
//! were rendered from that IR**". Two ways to get its timing wrong, and they are
//! not symmetric:
//!
//! * **Write it early** (before the pages) and a run that dies in the renderer
//!   leaves a ledger saying every module is up to date. The next run re-extracts
//!   nothing, re-renders nothing, and the site is permanently half-old **with no
//!   diagnostic anywhere**. This is the failure mode that matters.
//! * **Write it late but with hashes read late** and the same silence arrives by
//!   a different road: an olean rebuilt *while* this run was extracting gets
//!   recorded as the one its IR came from, and that module is never re-extracted
//!   again.
//!
//! So the rule is one sentence — **hash before extracting, write after
//! rendering** — and it is implemented as: the module hashes come from
//! [`litedoc4_incr::CheckSummary::fresh`] (or, on the first run, from a
//! `ledger build` that runs *before* the extractor), and the file is written by
//! [`write_ledger`] as the last thing a successful run does. Every failure
//! before that point — the extractor exiting non-zero (exit 4), the round loop
//! not converging (exit 5), a stage refusing (exit 3), the renderer failing
//! (exit 1) — leaves the previous ledger in place, and the next run redoes the
//! work. **Redoing work is the safe direction**; it is loud (the next run's
//! `changed` count says so) and it is finite.
//!
//! The two keys are the exception, and deliberately so: `extractKey` is
//! recomputed against the IR tree that now exists, not the one `detect` looked
//! at. They describe *the tree on disk*, and after a successful run that is the
//! merged tree. Writing back `detect`'s copy would leave a ledger claiming the
//! IR was written by whatever wrote the old one, and if the two differ every
//! later run re-extracts all 432 modules for ever.
//!
//! # What `renderKey` covers, and what `--full` is still for 【実測】
//!
//! `renderKey` was `renderer` + `sourceUrl` alone, so a run whose **dependency
//! map changed** and whose IR did not was not detected — and the map reaches 150
//! of the target's 432 pages' bytes 【実測, plan 決定 4】. That hole is closed
//! twice over: M5-b put the `.lidx`'s digest in the key, and M7-c put the
//! **dependency link map's** there ([`Request::external_links`]), so a bumped
//! dependency — which moves a `rev` and therefore every href into that package —
//! re-renders on its own.
//!
//! `--full` remains the escape hatch for whatever is *not* in the key — a set
//! that cannot be closed, because it is every input the ledger does not name.
//! And the M7-c key has a mirror-image cost worth stating: a run whose
//! resolution **degraded** (a package gone from disk, `lake` not on the path)
//! produces a smaller map, a different digest, and therefore a full re-render.
//! That is the right direction — the links really would have changed — but it
//! means an environment that half-works re-renders 432 pages rather than
//! reporting nothing.
