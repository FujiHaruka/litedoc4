//! The `prune` stage: the deletion path's page third.
//!
//! Ported from `experiments/stage5/prune-pages.ts` (frozen). Milestone **M3-c**.
//!
//! A module that no longer exists leaves three things behind, and the renderer
//! cleans up none of them because **it only ever writes**: `render --only` writes
//! the pages it was asked for and never looks at what else is in the tree. So a
//! deleted module's page survives every later incremental run and looks exactly
//! like a live one. The failure is silent, which is why stage 5b's S4 found the
//! pipeline exiting rather than pretending to have succeeded.
//!
//! The other two thirds: the IR is [`mod@crate::merge`]'s `--remove`, and the ledger
//! is rebuilt outright (`build` costs the same ~0.05 s as `check`, so there is no
//! reason for an incremental ledger-update path).
//!
//! ```text
//! --remove <file> ──> the pages of modules that are gone
//! --ir <dir>      ──> every .html under the root that is not a live module page
//!                     (orphans)
//! either          ──> directories the deletions left empty
//! ```
//!
//! # This is the one stage that deletes, so the guards are structural
//!
//! 1. **Every path is built by the renderer's own rule and checked against the
//!    root.** [`page_of`] turns dots into separators, so a name cannot carry a
//!    `..` past it — but that is an argument, and [`PageRoot`] is a check:
//!    lexically before the path is used, physically (`canonicalize`) before
//!    anything is unlinked. A path that resolves outside the page root is a
//!    refusal, not a deletion.
//! 2. **Paths are concatenated, never `Path::join`ed.** The prototype builds
//!    `` `${PAGES}/${page}` ``, and `Path::join` with an absolute right-hand side
//!    *discards the left* — so a `--remove` line of `/etc/passwd` would name
//!    `<pages>//etc/passwd.html` in JavaScript and `/etc/passwd.html` here. The
//!    difference is a deletion outside the tree.
//! 3. **The walk never descends a symlink.** `file_type()` does not follow, so a
//!    symlinked subdirectory is neither a directory to recurse into nor a file to
//!    keep — exactly as `Deno.readDir`'s `isDirectory` behaves.
//! 4. **`--dry-run` computes everything and writes nothing**, so the harness can
//!    compare *what would be deleted* without deleting it.
//!
//! # The orphan rule is about `.html`, and the site holds more than pages
//!
//! `--ir` deletes every `.html` under the root whose relative path is not
//! [`page_of`] of a module in the IR. On the target's **site** that is not only
//! the dead pages: four of the seven whole-package artifacts are `.html` files
//! no module owns, so the rule calls them orphans【実測 2026-08-12 —
//! `tools/impact-reference.sh` の `orphans-site` シナリオ】. **M8-d changed
//! which four, and raised the stakes**: it used to be `navbar.html`,
//! `references.html` and `tactics.html`, none of which anything read; it is now
//! `index.html`, `404.html`, `search.html` and `foundational_types.html` — the
//! site's front door, its not-found page, and the target of a link on all 432
//! module pages. The other three artifacts are not `.html`
//! (`declarations/name-map.json`, `modules.json`, `search-index.bin`) and are
//! invisible to it, as are the static assets (`style.css`, `app.js`,
//! `favicon.svg` since M8-a), which are **not in the byte-reproduction
//! denominator at all** (432 pages + 7 artifacts = 439 since M8-d; 438 at M6).
//!
//! **The pipeline never passes `--ir`** — `incremental.sh:304-305` passes only
//! `--remove` — so nothing has been deleting them. Reproduced as it is, and
//! written down here because "prune the orphans" is a plausible thing for M3-d to
//! start doing and it would take three artifacts with it.
//!
//! # The static assets survive both halves, and that is now asserted (M8-a)
//!
//! From M8-a every build writes `style.css`, `app.js` and `favicon.svg` into the
//! site root (`docs/plans/ui-redesign.md` 決定 6). They are **not** module
//! pages, no ledger names them, and nothing regenerates them mid-pipeline — so
//! an incremental run that deleted them would leave a site that renders unstyled
//! until the next full generation, which is a silent failure of exactly the kind
//! this stage's heading is otherwise about. Nothing here deletes them today: the
//! orphan rule only looks at names ending in `.html`, and the empty-directory
//! pass never removes the root. The two tests at the foot of this file hold it
//! to that, so a later change to either rule fails here rather than in a
//! browser.
