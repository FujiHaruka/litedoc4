# Build the **second target**: a small Mathlib-dependent Lean package that has
# never seen doc-gen4, generated from scratch by this script.
#
# The measurement target cannot answer whether the product derives everything
# itself: it carries a 736 MB doc-gen4 output tree, so a dependency map can
# always be handed to the renderer from outside. Here there is none.
#
# A generator and not a checked-in tree because the package lives under
# /private/tmp, which this machine empties. Everything — the two libraries, the
# module list, every boundary value — is *in this file*, so a number measured on
# target 2 can be re-derived from the repository alone.
#
# The dependencies are never resolved here: `lake update` needs the network and
# would pick today's Mathlib, and this package has to be built against **the same
# Mathlib the measurement target uses** (`fabf563a7c95`, Lean v4.31.0) or its
# numbers are not comparable with any other number in this repository. So
# `lake-manifest.json` and `lean-toolchain` are copied verbatim in **both** modes
# and the revisions are pinned by that manifest.
#
# `--deps` picks how the dependencies get there:
#   clone   an **APFS clonefile copy** (`cp -Rc`) of the measurement target's
#           `.lake/packages`: copy-on-write, ~0 real disk, no network, source
#           read and never written. A symlink would not do — Lake writes into a
#           package directory it believes it owns, and the measurement target may
#           not be written to. **macOS only**: `cp -c` is a BSD extension and the
#           filesystem has to be APFS.
#   fetch   `lake exe cache get` in the generated package. **Needs the network**,
#           and is the path a Linux runner takes — a GitHub runner has no
#           measurement target to clone from, only its checkout.
#   auto    (default) `clone` where `cp -Rc` works, `fetch` otherwise.
#
# The two modes are NOT interchangeable for measurement — the oleans are left in
# the state a download leaves them in, or in the state a copy-on-write leaves
# them in — so the mode is printed at the end.
#
# The sources carry, one per module so that a failure names itself, inputs that
# do not occur in the measurement target but can occur in a second package.
