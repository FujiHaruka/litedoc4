# M4-d — the gate of M4: **one command**, run against a clone of the measurement
# target, with a real edit and a real `lake build` in the middle.
#
# **Gate 1's site comparison is no longer run.** M7-c moved dependency links to
# version-pinned GitHub blob URLs and the reference side here predates it, so the
# two differ by design. It used to run anyway and report a difference the reader
# was told to ignore — which is the worst state for a gate to be in, because
# after that nobody reads its output at all. The property it stood for (one
# command produces the site the staged pipeline does) is now checked by
# `tools/e2e-micro.sh`, against a Mathlib-free fixture and a reference that is
# not stale. Gate A itself ended at M8 — see `docs/implementation-plan.md` §1 and
# `docs/plans/quality-gates.md`.
#
# The rest of this script still judges: the IR comparison, the module list, the
# second run, the real move and the real deletion.

# ============================================================================
# THE FIVE GATES
# ============================================================================
#   1  ONE COMMAND       `litedoc4 build` over a clean clone produces a site,
#                        and that site is byte-identical to the one
#                        `litedoc4 site` writes from the **independently
#                        extracted** base IR of M3-d4 (the frozen prototype's
#                        `extract-once.sh` + stage 7d binary). Denominator 438
#                        = 432 module pages + 6 whole-package artifacts.
#                        The IR trees are compared too (436 files), which is
#                        the stronger half: `build` derived its own module list,
#                        its own source URL and ran its own resident extractor,
#                        and the tree still has to come out the same bytes.
#
#   2  THE SECOND RUN    the same command again, with nothing changed: 0 to
#                        re-extract, 0 pages rendered, and **not one byte of the
#                        site moves**. This is what the ledger write-back buys;
#                        without it the second run re-extracts the first run's
#                        changed set (plan §7, M3-d2's debt 1).
#
#   3  THE WRITE-BACK    a **real** move inside the clone
#                        (`setup-clone.sh move … minimal` + `lake build`), then
#                        `build`, then `build` again. The second one must report
#                        **0 changed**. Without a write-back it would re-extract
#                        the same modules for ever, and the difference between
#                        "the ledger was written" and "the ledger was not" is
#                        exactly this run.
#
#   4  INCREMENTAL == FULL  the tree gate 3 left behind, against a `build` run
#                        from zero over the same edited sources, in a different
#                        --out. Byte for byte, denominator 439 (the move adds a
#                        module). This is M3-d4's gate 1 restated through
#                        `build`: both sides now derive the module list, the
#                        source URL and the layout themselves, so a difference
#                        in any of those three shows up here.
#
#   5  THE RESET         `setup-clone.sh reset`, then: `git status` empty,
#                        `lake build --no-build` = All targets up-to-date.
#
# ============================================================================
# WHAT IS NEVER TOUCHED
# ============================================================================
#   The measurement target /Users/haruka/dev/lean-projects is not opened for
#   writing by anything here — every path this script writes is under $OUT or is
#   the clone's own sources. The clone's `.lake/build/doc` (doc-gen4's reference
#   tree) is never touched and no `git commit` is ever run.
#
#   The clone is a baseline only if its oleans were built **at the clone's own
#   path** (`tools/rebuild-own.sh`): without that, a moved
#   declaration's referrers rebuild for the wrong reason and the gate passes for
#   a reason nobody meant (stage 5e (e)). `require_baseline` checks it with
#   `strings`, and checks that Lake considers the tree up to date.
