#!/usr/bin/env bash
# A-1 — the two halves of the rule, read out of the HTML a run actually wrote.
#
# WHAT IT PROVES WHEN IT FAILS, IN ONE LINE
#   Either "a link this run wrote to a dependency's documentation site does not
#   exist there", or "a name the table did not hold was linked at that site
#   anyway" — and it names the href, the page's HTTP status, the anchor the page
#   does not carry, or the name whose fallback did not happen.
#
# WHY IT IS A GATE AND NOT A TEST
#   It needs the measurement target, its toolchain, the Lean extractor **and the
#   network**. `cargo test --workspace` must never reach any of those, so this is
#   in tools/ with the rest of them and is not on any `cargo test` path.
#   `crates/litedoc4/src/deps_docs.rs`'s own tests read a declaration table from
#   disk; what they cannot ask is whether the other side's server agrees.
#
# THE RULE HAS TWO BRANCHES AND BOTH ARE CHECKED
#   deps_docs.rs states it as one rule with two outcomes: a name the site's
#   declaration table holds gets the documentation page; a name it does not hold
#   keeps the version-pinned source. **A gate that only checks the first branch
#   checks the half that is easy to get right.**
#
#   BRANCH 1 — verified names resolve.
#     Every `<base>/...` href the site wrote is collected out of the HTML,
#     entities and all, and split into a page and an `#anchor`. Each distinct
#     page is fetched (GET) and each distinct anchor is looked for in the bytes
#     that came back, as `id="<anchor>"` with the page's own escaping undone.
#
#     THE ANCHOR HALF IS THE POINT, AND IT IS NOT CHECKED AGAINST THE DECLARATION
#     TABLE. The cheap way to check anchors is to re-read the table the build
#     resolved from and confirm the name is in it — but that is the build's own
#     input, so it would answer "the resolver copied the table correctly" and
#     call it "the link resolves". A declaration renamed inside a module that
#     still exists is exactly the case the version-pinned fallback exists for
#     (`benchmarks/results/deps-link-rot-2026-08-19.txt` §4: Mathlib's deprecated
#     aliases expire after six months), and it is invisible to a page-only check
#     and to a table-only check alike. So the anchor is looked for in the page
#     the server actually served.
#
#     Measured cost of doing it the expensive way 【実測 2026-08-19】: a
#     mathlib4_docs page is 12-31 kB and ~0.2 s, so a few hundred of them fetched
#     six at a time is a couple of seconds — cheaper than the 5.7 MB table the
#     build itself downloads.
#
#   BRANCH 2 — names the table did not hold really fell back.
#     The resolved map says which names were asked about and which the table
#     answered for; the difference is the fallback set. For every name in it:
#
#       (a) **no href anywhere on the site is that name's documentation page** —
#           read off the collected hrefs by fragment, so a link to a page that
#           exists and answers 200 is caught just the same. Branch 1 cannot see
#           that one: a wrong-but-live page passes every HTTP check there is.
#       (b) where the name is linked at all, the href is its root's
#           **version-pinned source**. The base it is compared against is not
#           built here — `litedoc4 links --out` is asked for it, so this checks
#           the renderer against the product's own answer instead of against a
#           second implementation of the same string join (the trap
#           `main.rs`'s `LinkRow` doc names).
#
#     (b) is by anchor text, which is the *display* form: a name rendered as
#     notation (`≤`) or shortened does not match and is reported as not found by
#     text rather than as verified. (a) has no such gap.
#
#   WHY Init IS POINTED AT THE SITE BY DEFAULT AND NOT ONLY Mathlib
#     Because branch 2 is empty otherwise. On the measurement target the table
#     holds 396 of 396 Mathlib names and 127 of 130 Init names 【実測
#     2026-08-19】, so **Init is the only root where the fallback fires at all**
#     — and a default run that never fires it is a gate for one branch wearing
#     the name of two. mathlib4_docs documents Lean core, which is why Init has
#     an answer there to compare against.
#
# WHAT THIS DOES **NOT** COVER
#   * **Source links in general.** Branch 2 checks the fallback names' source
#     links and nothing else; the version-pinned URLs of the roots that were
#     never pointed at documentation are `litedoc4 links`' business (U1) and
#     the relative links are `tools/site-gate.sh`'s.
#   * **Names this package never refers to.** The denominator is what the run
#     resolved and what the site wrote; a dependency declaration mentioned only
#     inside a docstring reaches the page through the `.lidx` and is not in the
#     request set at all (`deps_docs.rs`, "what is kept in memory").
#   * **Resolved names the site never links.** They exist — 11 of 396 on the
#     measurement target — so branch 1's denominator is **the hrefs the site
#     wrote**, not the map's names. Counting the map's names would report links
#     as checked that were never written.
#   * **Anything about tomorrow.** mathlib4_docs is rebuilt from `master`, so a
#     pass is a statement about the minute it ran in and not about the site.
#   * **The page's own correctness.** `id="X"` present is not "X is documented
#     there and says the right thing".
#   * **Roots that were not pointed at documentation.** Lean, and whatever else
#     `--root-name` leaves out.
#
# HOW TO MAKE IT FAIL ON PURPOSE (and it has been, 【実測 2026-08-19】)
#   Three modes, one per thing the gate claims to see. All of them rewrite only
#   copies **under this script's own work area** — the repository, the target and
#   the built site are never modified, and no `git checkout` is involved.
#
#     --inject anchor    one resolved entry's `#anchor` becomes a name the page
#                        does not carry, and the pages are rendered from that
#                        map. The page still answers 200: this is the case a
#                        page-only check passes.
#     --inject page      the same entry points at a page the site does not have.
#     --inject fallback  branch 2. One **verified and linked** name is removed
#                        from the *reference* map, which makes it a fallback
#                        name while the real pages still link it at its real,
#                        live documentation page. Staged on the reference side
#                        on purpose: a documentation href that is live in every
#                        respect is the only thing branch 1 cannot see, and the
#                        only way to have one is to take a name that really is
#                        documented.
