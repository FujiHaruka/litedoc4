"""Does the site close over itself?

The UI is ours, so no third party knows what these bytes should be. What
survives the loss of an external oracle is what the tree can be asked about
*itself*. Nothing here needs the network, doc-gen4, or the corpus.

Seven questions, each printed with its 母数 so that a passing run says how much
it looked at rather than only that it was happy:

  1. modules.json      every module names a page that exists
  2. search-index      every declaration's module and kind subscript resolves
  3. search-index      every declaration is an anchor on its own module's page
  4. pages             every `class="decl"` anchor is in the search index
  4b. search-index     is the same fact as `declarations/name-map.json`
  5. instances         every instance name is a declaration the index knows
  6. instancesFor      every key and every value is a declaration
  7. resources         no <script src> / <link href> points at another host

(3) and (4) are deliberately the two directions of the same statement. One of
them alone is satisfied by an index that is a subset of the pages, or by pages
that are a subset of the index — and both of those are exactly how a renderer
and an index generator drift apart: the search box stops finding a declaration
that is on the page, or finds one that is not.

(7)'s subject is not `<a href>`: a link into a dependency's source is a
version-pinned GitHub blob URL by design, and clicking it is not the page
loading a resource.
