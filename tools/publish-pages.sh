# Publish a site tree built by `litedoc4 build` to a repository's Pages branch.
#
# The tree is published *as the whole branch*: the branch content is replaced,
# not merged into. That is the only way a removed module's page stops being
# served, and it is why this script clones into a scratch directory instead of
# touching the target repository's working tree.
#
# It does not push unless told to. The default run clones, stages the
# replacement and prints what would change — publishing is an outward-facing,
# hard-to-take-back action and it should not be the thing that happens when a
# flag is forgotten.
#
# usage:
#   tools/publish-pages.sh --site <dir> --repo <path-or-url> [options]
#
#   --site <dir>       the site tree to publish (as `litedoc4 build` wrote it)
#   --repo <path|url>  the repository that owns the Pages branch
#   --branch <name>    branch to replace (default: gh-pages)
#   --message <text>   commit message (default: a generated one)
#   --push             actually push. Without it, nothing leaves the machine
#   --keep             leave the scratch clone in place for inspection
