# Run seven end-to-end incremental scenarios against the measurement target and
# record what each one *computed* — not what it printed.
#
# **Rust only.** Until 2026-08-16 the scenarios below were also run against the
# TS prototype (`--impl ts` = `experiments/stage7h/incremental.sh`) so that the
# two implementations could be compared. `experiments/` was removed, so **that
# comparison can no longer be made from this tree** — the prototype exists only
# at tag `experiments-frozen`. What remains is `litedoc4 incremental`
# (`crates/litedoc4/src/pipeline.rs`).
#
# **`--extractor` selects what runs behind `litedoc4 incremental`'s `--extractor`
# flag** (M4-b). Both spellings drive the same Lean extraction; what differs is
# who spells the command line and who folds the events into the timings:
#
#   --extractor product   `litedoc4 extract` + extractor/build/extract (default)
#   --extractor resident  **no `--extractor` at all** (M4-c): `litedoc4
#                         incremental --serve` starts one Lean environment per
#                         run and asks it every round. The comparison this makes
#                         possible is the M4-c gate — the same seven scenarios
#                         through a server instead of a process per round have to
#                         produce the same answers, byte for byte.
#
# It is a flag rather than a replacement so that the gates are *comparisons*:
# record with one spelling, record with another, and run
# tools/incremental-compare.sh over the two. A third spelling used to exist —
# `--extractor proto`, the frozen `stage7g/extract-once.sh` + stage-7d binary,
# which is what the m3d3 recording was made with — and it went with
# `experiments/`.
#
# usage: tools/incremental-reference.sh [--extractor product|resident]
#                                       [--out DIR] [--target REPO] [--lib NAME]
#                                       [--lidx FILE] [--base-ir DIR] [--ref-site DIR]
#                                       [--only SCENARIO]...
#   --lib  the library whose modules are the module list; defaults to
#          `InformationTheory`, which is the measurement target's. A different
#          `--target` needs this too.
#
# ============================================================================
# WHAT IS RECORDED, AND WHY THE SHAPE IS THE SHAPE
# ============================================================================
#
# The three decisions below were taken while this harness still drove two
# implementations. **The recording shape is kept unchanged**, because a tree
# recorded before the TS side was removed has to stay comparable with one
# recorded after it — and because the same constraints hold between
# `--extractor product` and `--extractor resident`.
#
# 1. **Page bytes are not recorded** 【実測, 確定】.
#    The prototype's step 7 (`incremental.sh:371-373`) called `render.ts` without
#    `--link-index`; without that map **150 of the 432 pages came out with
#    different bytes**. `incremental.sh` was frozen, so it could never be repaired
#    on that side. What is recorded here is therefore **which pages exist** (a
#    sorted listing and a count), never their content — plus the six
#    whole-package artifacts, which `build_global` derives from the IR alone and
#    which therefore *are* comparable.
#
#    The page-byte check that this gives up is not lost, it is moved: every run
#    additionally rebuilds a whole site from the IR each scenario left behind and
#    diffs it against the page tree the incremental run produced
#    (`<s>-sitecheck.txt`). That is the stronger question anyway — "did the round
#    leave the tree a full run would have written".
#
# 2. **The module list is built here, once, under `LC_ALL=C`** 【実測, 確定】.
#    `litedoc4 modules` sorts in UTF-16 code-unit order; the prototype's
#    `find … | sort` sorted in the caller's locale, and on this machine's
#    `en_US.UTF-8` **163 of the 432 lines land in a different position** — same
#    set, same count. That order is not cosmetic: it is the order of the ledger's
#    `modules` array *and* (M3-d2b) the order of the merged `index.json`'s
#    `modules` array, i.e. it makes bytes. So this script builds the list once and
#    **checks it against `litedoc4 modules`, refusing to run if they differ** —
#    which is what documents the trap rather than merely avoiding it.
#
# 3. **The ledger and the global-derivation cache are seeded by the run itself.**
#    `extractKey.extractor` is *designed* to differ between implementations: a
#    ledger written by one must invalidate under the other (plan §6). A borrowed
#    ledger would report all 432 modules as changed and the run would be measuring
#    the key mismatch, not the pipeline. So each run builds its own
#    `base-ledger.json`, its own `base-site/` and its own `base-state/` out of the
#    given base IR — and the six whole-package artifacts of that `base-site/` are
#    recorded into the compared tree, which turns the seeding itself into an
#    oracle instead of a setup step nobody looked at.
#
# ============================================================================
# NOTHING OUTSIDE $OUT AND $OUT.work IS EVER WRITTEN TO
# ============================================================================
#   The pipeline deletes pages (`prune`) and rewrites an IR tree in place
#   (`merge`), so every scenario runs against copies under `$OUT.work` and
#   `guard_writable` refuses to run a scenario whose live tree is not under it.
#   The measurement target is opened **read-only**: the module list is a `find`
#   over its sources and the ledger hashes its oleans.
#
#   $OUT       the compared tree — records only, all of them implementation-neutral
#   $OUT.work  fixtures, live copies, work directories, from-scratch sites
#
# ============================================================================
# THE SEVEN SCENARIOS
# ============================================================================
#   nochange       nothing touched                    self       0 changed: the
#                  regeneration set is empty and the renderer is skipped (§6/5)
#   self-one       one module invalidated             self       the minimal edit
#   importers-hub  Shannon.Bridge invalidated         importers  the wide blast
#                  radius: 15 direct importers, 261 transitive 【実測 census】
#   referrers-two  Bridge + Polymatroid.Basic         referrers  two modules and
#                  a second closure (Bridge has 49 direct referrers 【実測】)
#   renderall      nothing touched, a different rev    self       the render key
#                  moves and overrides --mode with `all` (§6/4): 432 pages
#   removed-one    the module list drops one entry     self       the deletion
#                  path: detect's `removed` -> merge's drop -> prune
#   added-one      removed-one's trees, the 431-entry  self       the addition
#                  ledger, and the 432-entry list                 path — where
#                  M3-d2b (the merged index's order) becomes visible
#
#   The module the last three turn on is `InformationTheory.Meta.EntryPoint`:
#   **1 declaration, imports nothing itself, and is imported directly by 281 of
#   the 432 modules** 【実測 2026-08-15, `litedoc4 impact --census`】. It is not a
#   leaf. It is used here because its single declaration is an `initialize`, so
#   removing it moves one entry of the global name map and (predicted, checked by
#   the run) no other module's `refs`; with `--mode self` none of the 281
#   importers is walked, so the scenario stays cheap.
#
# ============================================================================
# WHAT IS RECORDED PER SCENARIO — the denominator of the comparison
# ============================================================================
#   <s>-status.txt       the exit code
#   <s>-stdout.txt       recorded, **not compared**: `litedoc4 incremental` prints
#                        a progress line per stage as well as the timings record
#                        (pipeline.rs's heading says so), and only the timings
#                        record is an answer. It is what <s>-counts.json is
#                        distilled from.
#   <s>-stderr.txt       recorded, **not compared** (wording is the
#                        implementation's); <s>-complained.txt carries the fact
#   <s>-counts.json      **the core**: the eight answers, lifted out of the run's
#                        timings JSON by this script so that two recordings are
#                        read the same way. No `*Seconds` — a duration is not an
#                        answer.
#   <s>-work/            the diagnostics the run left in `--work`
#   <s>-work-present.txt which of them exist. `impact-set.txt` is absent exactly
#                        when the changed set is empty and the mode is not `all`,
#                        and that absence is an answer, not a gap in the recording.
#   <s>-ir/              the whole IR tree the run left behind, byte for byte
#   <s>-global/          the six whole-package artifacts, byte for byte
#   <s>-pages.txt        which pages exist (see decision 1); <s>-pages-count.txt
#   <s>-sitecheck.txt    the within-run page-byte oracle, skipped by the comparator

# 2. One module invalidated: the minimal edit. `ledger touch` is the honest fake
#    the whole experiment rests on — the measurement target must not be modified,
#    so "M changed" is injected by invalidating M's ledger entry and everything
#    downstream is real (`litedoc4 ledger touch`).

# 6. The deletion path, end to end: the module list has one entry fewer, so

#    deletes its page. Nothing is re-extracted — round 1 runs for the deletion

#    and a 432-entry module list, so the module comes back. **This is where
#    M3-d2b shows**: the prototype's merge appends a new module to the end of the
#    index, the product orders the index by `--modules`. Same entries, different
#    sequence, and no page byte says so.
