//! Derived from doc-gen4 (Copyright (c) 2021 Henrik Böving, Apache-2.0) and
//! changed; see this repository's NOTICE and `docs/provenance.md`.
//!
//! `DocGen4/Output/DocString.lean:112-402`, transcribed.
//!
//! doc-gen4 builds an `Html` tree and then serialises it; every element the
//! docstring path creates is built with `flatten = true`, whose serialisation
//! (`ToHtmlFormat.lean:66`) is `<tag attrs>children</tag>` with no whitespace of
//! its own. Nothing here depends on the tree existing, so this writes the same
//! bytes straight into a `String`. The two node kinds that are *not* elements
//! still matter and are marked at each use: `Html.text` is escaped,
//! `Html.raw` is not.
//!
//! # What is deferred, and where it plugs in
//!
//! `nameToLink?` (`DocString.lean:39-80`) answers "does this name have a page?".
//! Its answer needs the union of three sources — the IR's module names, the
//! ledger's `known`, and the `@` sections of the `.lidx` file (plan §5, pitfall
//! 6) — and none of them belongs to a markdown crate. So it is a caller-supplied
//! [`LinkResolver`], and this milestone step ships [`NoLinks`], which resolves
//! no name. Its source-path branch is deferred the same way and for the same
//! reason, though it kept doc-gen4's index-free rule as the trait's default
//! (M8, gate UI-2). Everything downstream of it is here and is exercised: `extendLink`
//! reaches all four of its branches, and `autoLinkInline` still splits, still
//! retries on the last `.`, and still emits the same text nodes — with a
//! resolver that never answers, the anchors are simply absent.
//!
//! # What is *not* deferred, though it is next door
//!
//! `mdGetHeadingId` is in the same 150 lines of the prototype but needs no link
//! index at all — only Unicode general categories ([`crate::gc`]). It is here
//! because 1,500 of the target package's 4,947 docstrings contain a heading
//! 【実測】, and a renderer that cannot produce a heading's `id` could not be
//! compared against doc-gen4 on any of them.
//!
//! # Bibliography
//!
//! `docStringToHtml` also appends a reference-link definition for every citekey
//! the docstring mentions, and rewrites `references.html#ref_…` links into
//! backref anchors. The target package has no `.bib` file, so `refsMap` is
//! empty, `findAllReferences` finds nothing, and the appended text is exactly
//! `"\n\n"` — which is what [`Renderer::docstring`] appends. Anything else would
//! be a feature this milestone has no oracle for.
