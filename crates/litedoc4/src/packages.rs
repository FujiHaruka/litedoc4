//! Which GitHub blob prefix each **dependency's** module root belongs to.
//!
//! Milestone **M7-b**, and the whole of it is offline. This file reads the
//! three inputs below without a socket, because "no network in the product" is
//! the reason option (c) was rejected and is not a thing to give back:
//!
//! | value | where it comes from |
//! |---|---|
//! | a dependency's `url` + 40-hex `rev` | the target's `lake-manifest.json` |
//! | which module roots that dependency provides | a scan of `<packagesDir>/<name>/` |
//! | **Lean core's revision** | **`lake env lean --githash`** — core is not in the manifest |
//!
//! The result is a [`litedoc4_render::ExternalLinks`], which is the value type
//! and says what a lookup does with it.
//!
//! # Four things the scan found that a reading of Lake would not have 【実測】
//!
//! 1. **A manifest name is not always the directory name.** doc-gen4 is
//!    `«doc-gen4»` in the manifest — Lake writes a name that needs quoting with
//!    its guillemets — and `doc-gen4` on disk. The quotes are stripped here.
//! 2. **A module root is not always a `Foo.lean` *and* a `Foo/`.** MD4Lean ships
//!    `MD4Lean.lean` with no `MD4Lean/` next to it, so a scan that wanted both
//!    would silently lose a real root. The file is the rule; the directory is not
//!    consulted. The other direction — `Foo/Bar.lean` with no `Foo.lean` — exists
//!    on disk only as test and script trees (`MathlibTest/`, `scripts/`,
//!    `AesopTest/`), none of which is imported, so a directory alone is not a
//!    root here either.
//! 3. **Core's four roots do not share one prefix.** `Init`, `Lean` and `Std` are
//!    under `src/`, but **`Lake` is under `src/lake/`** — the reference tree links
//!    `Lake.Build` at `…/blob/<hash>/src/lake/Lake/Build.lean`. One base per root,
//!    not one base for core.
//! 4. **Two packages can claim one root.** doc-gen4 and MD4Lean both ship a
//!    `Main.lean`. Nothing imports either, so this costs no link — but it is not
//!    nothing, and it is reported separately from a failure ([`Packages`]) rather
//!    than resolved in silence.
//!
//! # Everything degrades; nothing throws
//!
//! A missing manifest, a package with no directory, a `lake` that will not run —
//! each costs the roots it would have contributed and adds a line to
//! [`Packages::problems`]. The caller decides whether a partial map is worth
//! rendering with, because the answer differs: a site with no external links is
//! the site v0.1 already ships, while a site missing *mathlib's* links is a
//! regression worth stopping for. Nothing here can panic on a shape of the
//! world.
//!
//! # A dropped entry still contributes its roots — with **no** base 【実測 2026-08-17】
//!
//! Dropping an entry that cannot be version-pinned used to drop its module roots
//! with it, and that was a dead link rather than a missing one: a root the map
//! does not hold is read by the renderer as *the package being documented*, so
//! every link into that dependency became a relative link to a page this site
//! never writes. Measured on a fixture whose manifest declares
//! `{"type": "path", "name": "dep", "dir": "../micro-dep"}`: three dead internal
//! links, one per shape (the import list, a docstring's name reference, a
//! signature's constant).
//!
//! So the entry is still dropped as a *link target* — there is no `/blob/<rev>`
//! and never will be one from this input — and its directory is still scanned,
//! and its roots go into the map **with an empty base**, which is the value
//! `litedoc4_render::NameIndex::link_to` answers `None` to. The problem line is
//! unchanged: the
//! entry did not resolve, and saying otherwise would be the report drifting from
//! the map.

///

/// The toolchain belongs to the package being documented, so the question "which
/// lean4 commit is this" can only be asked from inside it — the answer comes from
/// whatever `lean-toolchain` in `root` selects.
///
/// # Why not `lake env lean --githash`
///
/// That is what this was until 段 E, and it cost **0.763 s** of a 5.33 s
/// one-module incremental — the single largest item after the Lean environment
/// load【実測 2026-08-17 → `benchmarks/results/g3-attribution-2026-08-17.txt`】.
/// Nearly all of it is Lake's own start-up (`lake env` alone measured at 0.9618 s,
/// 段階 5), and `--githash` needs none of what Lake sets: not `LEAN_PATH`, not the
/// package's build tree, not its dependencies. **What it does need is the
/// toolchain, and that is elan's answer, not Lake's** — elan's `lean` shim
/// resolves the same `lean-toolchain` from the working directory that `lake env
/// lean` ultimately hands to the same shim. So the two spellings ask the same
/// question of the same program, and one of them starts Lake first.
///
/// **The two were measured to agree** before this was changed — on the
/// measurement target and on the synthetic second target, byte for byte, and the
/// sites built either way are byte-identical (同ログ). That equality is the whole
/// argument; if a setup ever breaks it, this returns a *different* revision
/// rather than an error, and every external link into Lean core points at the
/// wrong commit. The guard against that is [`is_revision`] plus the fact that the
/// value lands in `renderKey.externalLinks`, so a change re-renders every page
/// loudly rather than editing a few links quietly.
///
/// **Only stdout is read.** Warnings go to stderr — the target prints one about a
/// dependency with local changes 【実測】 — and folding those into the answer
/// would produce a revision that is not one.
