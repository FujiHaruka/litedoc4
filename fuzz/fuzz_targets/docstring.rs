//! Everything this crate does to a docstring, under libFuzzer and ASan.
//!
//! The subject is the C: `crates/litedoc4-md/vendor/md4c` is compiled by
//! `build.rs` and called across FFI, so the failure this hunts for is a
//! memory-safety failure that no amount of Rust-side review would show. A wrong
//! `<p>` is a different test's problem — what is asserted here is only that
//! control comes back and that ASan stays quiet.
//!
//! Crashes found here do not stay here: the input goes into
//! `fixtures/md/fuzz/`, where the stable-toolchain gate runs
//! it on every push.
