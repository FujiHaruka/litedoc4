"""Slice a `.lidx` into the part that belongs to a package and the part that does not.

usage: lidx-slice.py <in.lidx> <own-modules.txt> <mode> <out.lidx>

modes
  deps        drop own-package declaration groups; keep every `@` line
  deps-only   drop own-package declaration groups AND own `@` lines
  local       keep ONLY own-package declaration groups and own `@` lines

The point of the first two is to answer, without writing any Lean, whether the
own-package half of the map reaches the rendered bytes at all: the renderer
resolves an own-package name through the IR-derived index (`known`, built in
`Litedoc4.Render.Autolink`) before it ever asks the map, and a range it does get
back is dropped unless the link resolved into a *dependency* package
(`Litedoc4.External`).
If that reading is right, `deps` renders byte-identically to the full map.
