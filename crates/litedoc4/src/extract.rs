//! `litedoc4 extract` — one extractor process over a module list, and its phase
//! timers folded into one JSON object.
//!
//! Milestone **M4-b**. Ported from `experiments/stage7g/extract-once.sh` (87
//! lines, frozen), which did three things; this does two of them:
//!
//! 1. start the Lean extractor **inside the target package** through `lake env`,
//!    with the six flags that spell "IR schema 5";
//! 2. fold the extractor's events JSONL into a single timings object;
//! 3. ~~send the request to a resident extractor instead (`--serve-dir`)~~ —
//!    residency arrived in **M4-c** and it is **`litedoc4 incremental --serve`**,
//!    not a flag here. See [`crate::resident`]: a server that answers one request
//!    and stops is a one-shot process with a protocol in front of it, and the
//!    only caller that extracts more than once from one environment is the round
//!    loop. Every `--serve*` spelling is still refused by name below, now with
//!    that as the reason.
//!
//! This file's [`fold_timings`], [`FIXED_FLAGS`] and [`resolve`] are the resident
//! path's too: the two paths differ in **who owns the process**, and in nothing
//! else that reaches a byte.
//!
//! # Why this is a subcommand and not a library call 【判断】
//!
//! Every other stage of the pipeline is a library call ([`crate::pipeline`]'s
//! heading says why). This one is a process on purpose, and stays one:
//!
//! - **`litedoc4 incremental --extractor` already names a program**, and its
//!   contract is `<program> [<extractor-arg>…] --modules <list> --ir-dir <dir>
//!   --timings <file>` (`pipeline.rs`'s [`crate::pipeline`] `Extractor`). Making
//!   extraction a subcommand means the product can be its own extractor —
//!   `--extractor <litedoc4> --extractor-arg extract` — **without closing the
//!   seam**: the pipeline's tests still hand it a fake, so testing the pipeline
//!   still does not need Lean and a 20-second extraction.
//! - **The Lean binary cannot be linked in.** It is 171 MB, it is built by
//!   `extractor/build.sh` against the *target's* toolchain, and it has to run
//!   with that target as its working directory. `lake env` is the thing that
//!   sets that environment up, so a process boundary exists whatever this file
//!   does; what this file decides is only who spells the command line.
//!
//! # What is fixed here rather than exposed
//!
//! The six extraction flags — `--equations --refs --write-ir --tagged-code
//! --jobs N --ir-dir <dir>` (`extract-once.sh:63-64`) — are not configurable
//! except for `--jobs` and `--ir-dir`. Four of them *are* the IR the rest of the
//! product reads: `--tagged-code` is what makes it schema 5, `--refs` is what
//! fills the reference arrays that the link resolution and `ownership` both
//! consume, and `--write-ir` is the point. A run with any of them off produces a
//! tree that parses and renders wrongly, which is the worst failure shape this
//! project has. They are refused by name, with the reason, rather than silently
//! accepted or silently ignored.

/// Note that a `<phase>:<name>Us` key is a *sub-phase duration*, not a count —
