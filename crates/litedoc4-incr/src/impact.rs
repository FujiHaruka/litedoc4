//! The `impact` stage (layer L3-2): a changed module set in, the set of pages
//! that have to be rewritten out.
//!
//! Ported from `experiments/stage5/impact.ts` (frozen). Milestone **M3-c**.
//!
//! ```text
//! IR ──> imports  ──reverse, transitive──> IMPORTERS(M)
//!    └─> refs     ──reverse, direct─────> REFERRERS(M)
//!                                            │
//!                 --changed / --changed-file ┴──> --print-set
//! ```
//!
//! # Two closures, because they answer different questions
//!
//! **IMPORTERS(M)** is the reverse *transitive* import closure of `M`, cut down
//! to the package's own modules. It is the **sound** bound: a module that does
//! not transitively import `M` cannot observe anything `M` declares — not a
//! constant, not notation, not an instance. Nothing in Lean reaches further.
//!
//! **REFERRERS(M)** is the modules with at least one `refs` entry whose defining
//! module is `M`. It is a *subset* of IMPORTERS(M) — to name `M`'s constant you
//! must import `M` — and it is the set whose **printed text** mentions something
//! of `M`'s.
//!
//! Neither is "the answer" on its own, which is why `--mode` exists and why
//! nothing here picks a default for the pipeline.
//!
//! # What this stage is *not* given, and why that is not an oversight
//!
//! The whole-package name map's delta (plan §6, constraint 2: `global` runs
//! **before** `impact`) is the other half of L3-2 — the pages whose docstring
//! links went stale because a name moved somewhere else entirely. It arrives as
//! [`crate::detect`]'s sibling file, `global-set.txt`, and **this stage never
//! reads it**: `incremental.sh:354-360` unions the two sets *after* both have
//! been computed, which is the point of deriving them separately. So the
//! constraint is the pipeline's to keep (M3-d), and the union is the pipeline's
//! to take.
//!
//! Two consequences worth writing down before M3-d inherits them:
//!
//! - **A `global-set.txt` with no changes is 0 bytes, not a blank line**
//!   (plan §7, M2 の結果). An empty *file* is a real answer here — "no page went
//!   stale through the map" — and must not be read as "nobody said".
//! - **When the changed set is empty and `--mode` is not `all`, this stage
//!   writes no `--print-set` at all** (`impact.ts:179` guards the whole block).
//!   The prototype's pipeline then feeds `sort -u` a file that does not exist.
//!   Reproduced exactly ([`ImpactRun::summary`] is `None`), because changing it
//!   would move bytes that the oracle compares — but the caller has to treat a
//!   missing file as the empty set, and M3-d is where that belongs.
//!
//! # M3-b's key-order change does not reach here【実測 2026-08-12】
//!
//! The merger now writes `deps/*.json` and `index.json`'s `dependencyMaps`
//! entries in **Lean's** order rather than the prototype's (plan §7, M3-b の
//! 決着). This stage reads neither: it needs `index.modules[]`'s `module`,
//! `file` and `bytes`, and each module file's `imports` / `declarations`.
//! Measured rather than reasoned — two trees merged from the same inputs by the
//! two implementations differ in exactly those four files (same byte counts,
//! different bytes) and produce **byte-identical** census, `--print-set` and
//! summary, and a byte-identical `prune --ir` report.
//!
//! # What builds the module list is not this stage either
//!
//! Same division as `detect`'s (plan §5, M3-d): the package's module list comes
//! from a **glob over the sources**. A walk of `.lake/build` picks up 659 orphan
//! oleans【実測】. Here the list comes from `index.json`, so the question does
//! not arise — but `--changed` names are checked against it, and a name that is
//! not one of the package's modules is a **refusal** (exit 3) rather than a
//! silently empty answer.
//!
//! # Two places this port is not the prototype, both refusals
//!
//! - **A module file that disagrees with the index about which module it is.**
//!   The prototype keys every map by the *file's* own `module` field, so an
//!   index entry pointing at the wrong file silently produces a graph with a
//!   node nobody asked for; the reader here checks the two agree and stops
//!   (exit 1). Same choice `ownership` makes, and for the same reason: a graph
//!   with the wrong nodes under-renders, and under-rendering has to be loud.
//! - **A summary is printed after the files are written, not before.** The
//!   prototype prints it first (`impact.ts:228-230`), so a failing write leaves
//!   the answer on stdout and a non-zero exit. Nothing downstream reads stdout,
//!   and the two orders differ only on a failing write.
//!
//! Reads the IR only. Lean is never started and the measurement target is never
//! touched.
