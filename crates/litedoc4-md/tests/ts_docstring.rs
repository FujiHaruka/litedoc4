//! Where this crate and the frozen TypeScript prototype disagree, and why that
//! is the prototype's limit rather than a regression.
//!
//! The prototype hand-wrote a 594-line CommonMark subset because TypeScript had
//! no byte-compatible parser; this crate links the real md4c. **Whichever side
//! matches doc-gen4 is right, and md4c is not to be bent towards the subset.**
//!
//! So this file is not a second expectation. It is the list of inputs on which
//! the prototype and doc-gen4 differ, produced by
//! `tests/oracle/gen-ts-docstring-expected.ts` from the prototype's own code —
//! **a frozen value: the generator and the prototype exist only at tag
//! `experiments-frozen`, so HEAD cannot regenerate it** — plus the assertion
//! that on every one of them this crate is on doc-gen4's side. `tests/docgen4.rs`
//! is what says so positively; what is added here is that the difference is
//! *real*, since a port that had quietly reproduced the subset's behaviour would
//! fail [`the_prototype_is_the_one_that_differs`].
//!
//! Over the whole corpus (4,987 inputs: every one of the 4,858 real docstrings
//! plus the 129 hand-written cases doc-gen4 survives), the prototype differs
//! from doc-gen4 on **41**, of which **exactly one is a real docstring**
//! 【実測 2026-08-11】. The other 40 are the corners the subset's own comment
//! says it does not implement: tables, task lists, images, hard breaks,
//! entities, permissive autolinks, reference links, strikethrough, backslash
//! escapes, CRLF and NUL.
