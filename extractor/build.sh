# Builds litedoc4's extractor (Extract.lean, IR schema 5) into a native binary
# under `build/`.
#
# Moved from `experiments/stage7d/build.sh` in M4-a. **The shape is unchanged**
# — only the path to `env.sh` moved one directory up, because this script now
# sits at the repository root instead of two levels down. In particular the two
# steps below are still two steps and `leanc` is still called with `-rdynamic`;
# see the comment there.
#
# litedoc4 has no toolchain and no Mathlib of its own, so the Lean environment is
# borrowed from the measurement target through `lake env` (CLAUDE.md).
# `TARGET_REPO` selects it.
#
# There *is* a `lakefile.lean` at the root now, and it builds the same extractor
# as a `lean_exe`. This script is still the one
# the benchmarks and `tools/ci-build.sh` use: the two builds do not produce the
# same bytes (Lake adds a package symbol prefix and `-O3`) even though they write
# byte-identical IR, and every number in `benchmarks/` was taken with this one.
# `tools/lake-package-gate.sh` item 4 is what keeps the two paths honest.
#
# usage: build.sh
