# Two **real** edits inside a clone of the measurement target, each followed by a
# real `lake build`, each run through the incremental pipeline.
#
# **The sibling of tools/incremental-reference.sh**: same per-scenario record
# shape (`<s>-counts.json` / `<s>-work/` / `<s>-status.txt` /
# `<s>-complained.txt` / `<s>-pages.txt` / `<s>-work-present.txt` / `<s>-ir/` /
# `<s>-global/`), so tools/incremental-compare.sh reads this tree unchanged.
#
# usage: tools/clone-gate.sh <phase> [--clone DIR] [--out DIR]
#                            [--lidx FILE] [--shared DIR] [--jobs N]
#                            [--move-module <Module>]
#   phases: setup | move | delete | reset | all
#
# **Why the edits are real.** `ledger touch` invalidates a ledger entry and does
# not touch the olean, and re-extracting a module whose olean did not move
# reproduces its IR byte for byte — so a harness built on it drove `staleFound`
# and `globalStale` to 0 in 7 of 7 scenarios and never reached a second round
# 【実測 2026-08-15】: the two derivations that make this pipeline non-trivial
# were only ever compared on the empty answer. Here the sources are really edited
# and `lake build` really runs, so **`staleFound`, `globalStale` and `rounds >= 2`
# have to come out non-empty** — if they do not, the module choice or the protocol
# is wrong and the run must be stopped rather than "passed".
#
# The two scenarios:
#
#   move    `--move-module`'s body moves into a new module `…Core`; the original
#           becomes a one-line shim. Site denominator **439** = 432 pages + 6
#           whole-package artifacts + the new module's page.
#
#           **The module is a parameter and choosing it wrong costs the run one of
#           the two derivations.** Having referrers is necessary and not
#           sufficient: `staleFound` reads the IR's `refs` — who *names* a moved
#           declaration — while `globalStale` reads `ModuleFacts::tokens`, built
#           from declaration docstrings' code spans and markdown link targets only
#           — who *documents* one. Only **7 of the 432 modules** have any of their
#           declarations named inside another module's docstring at all, so the
#           second condition is the scarce one 【実測 2026-08-15】; the default
#           below is the one of those 7 with the widest reference set 【実測
#           census + `litedoc4 global --before`】: declarations 25,
#           referrersDirect 33, documented by `…BroadcastChannel.Marton.Basic`, so
#           the map delta reports 25 names moved and 1 module affected.
#
#   delete  `InformationTheory.Shannon.ArithmeticCoding`'s source file is deleted
#           and the single `import` line naming it is removed from
#           `InformationTheory.lean`. Chosen because it is imported by **exactly
#           one** file 【実測 census: declarations 6, importedByDirect 1,
#           importersTransitive 1, referrersDirect 0】, so the build stays green.
#           **Lake does not delete the orphaned olean** and this script leaves it
#           where it is: the module list is a glob over the *sources*, so the
#           module correctly reads as gone, and the orphan is the field test of
#           not picking orphaned oleans up.
#           Site denominator **437** = 431 pages + 6 whole-package artifacts.
#
# **The gate** (recorded in `<s>-sitecheck.txt`): INCREMENTAL — the base
# {ir, pages, ledger, state} copied, then `litedoc4 incremental` over the
# **post-edit** module list — compared with `/usr/bin/diff -r` against
# FROM-SCRATCH, the same post-edit module list extracted from zero and put
# through `litedoc4 site`. Bytes, whole tree, plus the same comparison one layer
# down on the IR.
#
# **The protocol.** The clone is a baseline only if its oleans were built **at
# the clone's own path** (`tools/rebuild-own.sh`); without that the moved
# module's referrers rebuild for the wrong reason and **the gate passes for a
# reason nobody meant**. `require_baseline` checks that with `strings`, checks
# `git status` is clean, checks Lake reports every target up to date, and — once
# a base ledger exists — checks the ledger's own fixed point (0 changed, 0 added,
# 0 removed against the base IR), which is what says a `reset` really put the
# oleans back.
#
# **Nothing outside $OUT, $OUT.work, $SHARED and the clone's sources is
# written.** The measurement target is never opened for writing; the clone's
# `.lake/build/doc` is never touched; no `git commit` is ever run.
#
# Shared between runs, in $SHARED: the module lists (before / after each edit)
# and every IR tree the **extractor** produces. Extraction is deterministic given
# the module list, so producing these twice would only add a way for two runs to
# be handed different inputs. Not shared, per run in $OUT.work/fixtures:
# `base-site/`, `base-state/`, `base-ledger.json` — `extractKey.extractor` and
# `STATE_DERIVATION` are **designed** to differ between implementations, so one
# run's seed under another reports every module changed and measures the key
# mismatch instead of the pipeline.
